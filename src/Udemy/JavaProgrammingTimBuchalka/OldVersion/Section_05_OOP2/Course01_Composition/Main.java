/*                                              The Composition Exercise

        Create a single room of a house using composition. Think about the things that should be included in the room.
    Maybe physical parts of the house but furniture as well. Add at least one method to access an object via a getter and
    then that objects public method as you saw in the previous lecture, then add at least one method to hide the object
    e.g. not using a getter but to access the object used in composition within the main class like you saw in this lecture.
