/*
Part-2
        Like a class, a new source file is created, with the name DayOfTheWeek.java, and we have the enum type, name, and
    body, created for us. And like other types, the enum at this level, can use either the public access modifier, or none
    at all. The enum constant names can be anything you want them to be. In this example, I'll create an enum of the short
    names for days of the week.

public enum DayOfTheWeek {

    SUN, MON, TUES, WED, THURS, FRI, SAT

/*
Part-3
        The important thing to notice here, is that we're coding these labels, all in uppercase, which is the convention
    for constants. And this is not really a statement, meaning we don't have to end it with a semi-colon(;) here. So that's
    the first enum type. They are very simple to set up, and quite useful to use in code.

        Next, we want to see what we can do with this, in the main method of the Main Class.
