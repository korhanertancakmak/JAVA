# LinkedinList Challenge

The challenge said to create a type for the place or town to visit, or the itinerary item.
Did you create a class for this?
That would've been a good way to solve it, but Java does offer a much easier option, the record.
I'm going to create a record, and put it in the Description.txt source file.
