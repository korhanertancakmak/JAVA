/*
        In the last lecture, I started setting up my Adventure Game. I included some nested types, an enum for compass
    directions, and a location record, as well as a static text block with my board location data. In this lecture, I'll
    complete this challenge as well as the bonus part, which is to allow customization. To do this, I want to get back
    to my constructors in the AdventureGame class, first the one with a single argument.

        I'm going to call my load locations method, passing the static string, GAME_LOCATIONS, to the loadLocations method.
    If I wasn't allowing customizations, I'd be done, but I do want to use custom locations, so I'll set up an if statement.
    If there are custom locations passed to this constructor, then I'll call load locations again, passing that data.
    This is the customization piece. A user can pass in their own locations. These locations will get loaded after the
    default locations. This means the user's location will replace the default location, if the key is already in the map.
    If customLocations isn't null, I'll load these customLocations. Finally, I want to go back to the no args constructor,
    and chain it to the other constructor, just passing null. Ok, so that's the code to load the game data. Let's go to

    takes a string, a direction. This method needs to first get the nextPlaces map, from the last place the player was at.
    It has to check if it's one of the four valid directions (in the enum), otherwise it prints invalid direction. If they
    did enter a valid direction, I want to use that as the key to the next places map. If I get null back, then the user
    picked a direction that's not in the next places map. Remember that not all locations, have a place to go, for all 4

    of the location to visit, or the location key. I'll use containsKey on the adventure map, passing it the location,
    the string value, to make sure it's a valid location, and that it's a key in my map. If it's not, I'll print out that
    it's not a valid location. Otherwise, I want to retrieve the location record, from the adventureMap, using the location
