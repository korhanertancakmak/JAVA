# [Section-11: Collections Framework]()
<div align="justify">

It represents different types of collections, such as sets, lists, and maps, 
belong to this framework. 
In this section, I'll revisit these types a little bit, 
to demonstrate how they fit into 
the big picture of this series of interfaces and classes. 
I'll also cover some other crucial types of collection objects, 
such as sets and maps.
By the end of this section,
you'll have a few more classes in your tool box for groups of many objects. 
Letâ€™s get started.

A **collection** is just an object
that represents a group of objects.
In general, the group of objects has some relationship to each other.
Computer science has common names,
and an expected set of behavior,
for different types of collection objects.
Collection objects, in various languages,
include arrays, lists, vectors, sets, queues, tables, dictionaries,
and maps (not geographical maps, but data maps).
These are differentiated by the way
they store the objects in memory,
how objects are retrieved and ordered,
and whether nulls and duplicate entries are permitted.
Oracle's Java documentation describes its _collections framework_ as:
_A unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections,
enabling collections to be manipulated independently of implementation details_.
That's a mouthful, but the term manipulated independently of implementation
details should give you a hint that it's based on interfaces.
If you're interested in reading the Oracle documentation,
they have a good overview at the following
[link](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/collections/overview.html)

This was written for JDK-8, but it still applies.
Strictly speaking, arrays and the array utilities in the **java.util.Arrays** class
are not considered part of this framework.
All collection objects implement the Collection interface,
except maps, and I'll explain why in this section.
</div>

## [a. Collection Interface]()

<div align="justify">

The Collection interface is the root of the collection hierarchy. 
Like most roots in software hierarchies, it's an abstract 
representation of the behavior you'd need for managing a group of objects. 
This type is typically used to _pass "collections_ around, 
and manipulate them where _maximum generality_ is desired. 
Remember, the interface lets us describe objects by what they can do, 
rather than what they really look like, 
or how they're ultimately constructed. 
If you look at the methods on this interface, 
you can see the basic operations a collection of any shape, 
or type, would need to support.

![image01](https://github.com/korhanertancakmak/JAVA/blob/master/src/Udemy/JavaProgrammingTimBuchalka/NewVersion/Section_11_Collections/images/image01.png?raw=true)

We've already looked at every one of these operations
in our study of ArrayLists and LinkedLists. 
When managing a group, you'll be adding and removing elements, 
checking if an element is in the group, and iterating through the elements.
There are some others, but these are the ones that describe nearly 
everything you'd want to do to manage a group.
Java uses the term **Element** for a member of the group being managed. 
Let's jump into IntelliJ and see what we can do with this interface.

First, I'll create an empty array list of type String 
and assign it to a list local variable. 
I'll then create an array of Strings, 
and I'll use an array initializer to assign the names. 
I'll add these strings via a call to _addAll_, 
nesting a call to **Arrays.asList**. 
Print the list.

```java  
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
String[] names = {"Anna", "Bob", "Carol", "David", "Edna"};
list.addAll(Arrays.asList(names));
System.out.println(list);
```

This should be familiar ground for you. 
Running that:

```java  
[Anna, Bob, Carol, David, Edna]
```
            
I get all the names printed out.
I'll add a couple more statements, again, 
just using methods I showed you
that are defined on the Collection interface. 
Let's add another name, Fred. 

```java  
list.add("Fred");
list.addAll(Arrays.asList("George", "Gary", "Grace"));
System.out.println(list);
System.out.println("Gary is in the list? " + list.contains("Gary"));
```

And three more, via call to addAll,
and as list as we did earlier.
Print what we have.
Running that code:

```java  
[Anna, Bob, Carol, David, Edna]
[Anna, Bob, Carol, David, Edna, Fred, George, Gary, Grace]
Gary is in the list? true
```

I'll add a _removeIf_ statement for good measure with a lambda expression,
which will remove any names from the list 
that start with **G**, checking if _charAt(0) = G_. 

```java  
list.removeIf(s -> s.charAt(0) == 'G');
System.out.println(list);
System.out.println("Gary is in the list? " + list.contains("Gary"));
```

And I'll copy the 2 println statements from above 
to below this statement. 
Running that:

```java  
---(same)
[Anna, Bob, Carol, David, Edna, Fred]
Gary is in the list? false
```
            
These are all methods, defined on the Collection interface, 
but executed on a specific implementation, the ArrayList, 
but assigned to a List variable.

```java  
//List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
Collection<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
```

I can actually abstract my variable type further, to Collection. 
I can still add elements and check if an element is in the collection. 
And all of my code compiles and runs, as before.
Ok, this is nothing new or exciting it's just how interfaces work. 

```java  
//List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
//Collection<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
Collection<String> list = new TreeSet<>();
```

Now, let's change ArrayList to say TreeSet in that first statement. 
TreeSet is a different implementation, 
meaning it implements the Collection interface,
and don't worry I'll be talking about this class in detail coming up. 
Right now, I just want to swap out my collection type for another, 
that is significantly different from an ArrayList. 
And this code still runs, and the output is the same.

```java  
//List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
//Collection<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
//Collection<String> list = new TreeSet<>();
Collection<String> list = new HashSet<>();
```

Now, let's try a different implementation, HashSet. 
This compiles and runs too:

```java  
[Edna, Bob, David, Carol, Anna]
[Gary, Edna, Bob, George, Grace, David, Fred, Carol, Anna]
Gary is in the list? true
[Edna, Bob, David, Fred, Carol, Anna]
Gary is in the list? false
```
                
But the output is different, isn't it? 
The elements aren't ordered. 
Not all collections are implicitly ordered,
by the way you add the elements, 
the insertion order in other words, like lists are. 
What if I wanted to sort this? 
Can I just call the _sort_ method on **List** as we did before? 
I'll add that statement, calling sort on my list variable 
right below the last println. 

```java  
String[] names = {"Anna", "Bob", "Carol", "David", "Edna"};
list.addAll(Arrays.asList(names));
System.out.println(list);

list.add("Fred");
list.addAll(Arrays.asList("George", "Gary", "Grace"));
System.out.println(list);
System.out.println("Gary is in the list? " + list.contains("Gary"));

list.removeIf(s -> s.charAt(0) == 'G');
System.out.println(list);
System.out.println("Gary is in the list? " + list.contains("Gary"));
list.sort();
```

But this doesn't compile, and if I hover over that, the error says,
_cannot resolve **sort** in Collection_. 
The Collection interface doesn't have a sort method.
The List interface does, but the Collection interface is more abstracted than a list. 
Another thing to know about the Collection interface is that 
there aren't any direct implementations of this top level interface. 
Other interfaces are derived from it,
and implementations (or concrete classes) implement the derived interfaces, 
like List and Set. 

![image02](https://github.com/korhanertancakmak/JAVA/blob/master/src/Udemy/JavaProgrammingTimBuchalka/NewVersion/Section_11_Collections/images/image02.png?raw=true)

This chart above shows the interface hierarchy.
It's also showing the implementations or concrete classes that
implement these interfaces, in bottom parts. 
Notice that **Map** does not extend Collection,
although still part of this framework. 
Maps are uniquely different, which I'll be explaining 
when I cover Maps in this section. 
You can see that LinkedList implements both List and Deque (double-ended queue), 
and I discussed this in detail when I covered LinkedLists.
Let's look at this on chart for an interface we know pretty well by now, **List**.
</div>

### List Interface
<div align="justify">

![image03](https://github.com/korhanertancakmak/JAVA/blob/master/src/Udemy/JavaProgrammingTimBuchalka/NewVersion/Section_11_Collections/images/image03.png?raw=true)

This chart shows the List interface extending Collection. 
For simplicity, I'm not showing the Collection methods that 
I showed on the previous chart. 
I'm only showing additional methods specifically declared on the List interface. 
We covered most of these methods, but I wanted you to see here that 
most of these are dealing with an index. 
A list can be either indexed, as an ArrayList, or not, like a LinkedList, 
but a LinkedList is implemented to support all of these methods as well. 
Derived interfaces may have specific ways to add, remove, get, 
and sort elements for their specific type of collection, 
in addition to those defined on the Collection Interface itself. 
Now, let's look at the big picture of interfaces
and some specific implementations.

![image04](https://github.com/korhanertancakmak/JAVA/blob/master/src/Udemy/JavaProgrammingTimBuchalka/NewVersion/Section_11_Collections/images/image04.png?raw=true)

A List is an ordered collection (also known as a sequence). 
These can be sequenced in memory like an ArrayList,
or maintain links to the next and previous values, as a LinkedList.                           
</div>

### Queue Interface
<div align="justify">

A Queue is a collection designed for holding elements prior to processing, 
in other words, the processing order matters, 
so the first and last positions, or the head and tail,
are prioritized. 
Most often these may be implemented as First In, First Out (FIFO), 
but can be implemented like a Stack, as Last In First Out (LIFO) 
which we've discussed.
Remember a Deque supports both.

![image05](https://github.com/korhanertancakmak/JAVA/blob/master/src/Udemy/JavaProgrammingTimBuchalka/NewVersion/Section_11_Collections/images/image05.png?raw=true)
</div>

### Set Interface
<div align="justify">

A Set is a collection conceptually based off of mathematical sets. 
Importantly, it contains no duplicate elements,
and isn't naturally sequenced or ordered.
You can think of a set as a kind of penned in chaotic grouping of objects.

![image06](https://github.com/korhanertancakmak/JAVA/blob/master/src/Udemy/JavaProgrammingTimBuchalka/NewVersion/Section_11_Collections/images/image06.png?raw=true)

Java has three implementations,
which I'll be reviewing in this section of the course in detail, 
the HashSet, the TreeSet and the LinkedHashSet. 
These are distinguished by the underlying way they store the elements in the set.
A Sorted Set is a set that provides a total ordering of the elements.
</div>

### Map Interface
<div align="justify">

A Map is a collection that stores key and value pairs. 
The keys are a set, and the values are a separate collection,
where the key keeps a reference to a value. 
Keys need to be unique, but values don't. 

![image07](https://github.com/korhanertancakmak/JAVA/blob/master/src/Udemy/JavaProgrammingTimBuchalka/NewVersion/Section_11_Collections/images/image07.png?raw=true)

Elements in a tree are stored in a key value Node, also called an Entry. 
In the sections coming up, we'll be looking at Set and Map, 
and how they resemble and differ from **List**. 
But before that, I want to talk about polymorphic algorithms.
</div>

### What's a polymorphic algorithm?
<div align="justify">

Oracle's documentation describes a polymorphic algorithm 
as a piece of reusable functionality.
At one time, most of these methods were provided to us, 
as static methods, on a class called **java.util.Collections**. 
Since JDK-8, and the advent of multiple interface enhancements, 
some of these methods are now on the interfaces themselves, 
as default or static methods. 
But not all, so I'll be discussing this class, 
and what it has to offer, in comparison to what's available on each collection class. 
It's also important to understand that legacy code 
will be using this class for some operations that can be done from the class itself. 
I'll comment out that last line of code 
so that the class still compiles. 

```java  
String[] names = {"Anna", "Bob", "Carol", "David", "Edna"};
list.addAll(Arrays.asList(names));
System.out.println(list);

list.add("Fred");
list.addAll(Arrays.asList("George", "Gary", "Grace"));
System.out.println(list);
System.out.println("Gary is in the list? " + list.contains("Gary"));

list.removeIf(s -> s.charAt(0) == 'G');
System.out.println(list);
System.out.println("Gary is in the list? " + list.contains("Gary"));
//list.sort();
```

Next, I'll be talking about this helper class and its methods. 
There are some fun polymorphic algorithms on there I haven't covered,
so I'll see you in that next section.
</div>

## [b. java.util.Collections Methods]()
<div align="justify">

In this lecture, I want to set up a Card class, 
which will be used to create a deck of playing cards. 
I'll be using these cards, and decks of cards, 
to demonstrate many of the methods on **java.util.Collections**. 
The Card will have three fields:

* a Suit, meaning Club, Diamond, Heart, or Spade.
* a face field, which will be a String, containing either 
the number of the card, 
or the face value of the card, Jack, Queen, King or Ace.
* a rank, an integer.

The Card should override the _toString_ method, 
and print the card with the face value (abbreviated, if a face card),
the _ascii_ character of the suit, and the rank in parentheses.
I'm including the _ascii_ characters 
that will print out each suit as a printable character.

```java  
CLUB  = 9827
DIAMOND = 9830
HEART = 9829
SPADE = 9824
```

The card should have the following public static methods 
to help anyone to use this class:

* _getNumericCard_ which should return an instance of a Card, 
based on the suit and number passed to it.
* _getFaceCard_ which should return an instance of a Card, 
based on the suit and abbreviation (J, Q, K, A) passed to it.
* _getStandardDeck,_ which should return a list of cards 
you'd find in a standard deck. 
See the previous notes for a full set of cards.
* _printDeck_, which should take a description, 
a list of cards, and a row count. 
This method will print the cards out in the number of rows passed.
* Finally, the card should have an overloaded printDeck method 
that will print _Current Deck_ as the description, 
and use 4, as the number of rows to be printed.

![image08](https://github.com/korhanertancakmak/JAVA/blob/master/src/Udemy/JavaProgrammingTimBuchalka/NewVersion/Section_11_Collections/images/image08.png?raw=true)

This chart shows my own plan, or the class diagram I'll be coding towards. 
I'm going to create a Card class. 
In my case, I'm just going to make it a record, 
because once a card is created, 
there's no sense in allowing anyone to change it.

Using a record gives me built in immutability,
if all my attributes are simple data types, like primitives and Strings.
Maybe you decided to create a Deck class, to contain your cards, 
and that's a good idea too. 
For the examples ahead, I'm just going to use List as my Deck container.

```java  
public record Card(Suit suit, String face, int rank) {
    public enum Suit {
        CLUB, DIAMOND, HEART, SPADE;

        public char getImage() {
            return (new char[]{9827, 9830, 9829, 9824})[this.ordinal()];
        }
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {

        int index = face.equals("10") ? 2 : 1;
        String faceString = face.substring(0, index);
        return "%s%c(%d)".formatted(faceString, suit.getImage(), rank);
    }
}
```

First, I'll create a new record in the same package, 
and call that **Card**. 
I'll add my fields in the parentheses there, 
first a field with a type of **Suit**. 
That type is going to be an **enum** 
I'll create in just a minute, and that field will be named suit in lowercase. 
I'll follow that with a string field called face, and an int named rank.
I'm going to insert my enum **Suit** as a nested type in this record. 
I'll make it public because other classes, 
not in my package, might use it later down the road. 
It'll have four constants, each representing a suit, 
so **CLUB**, **DIAMOND**, **HEART**, and **SPADE**. 
For the standard deck, there's no real difference in ranking 
for these suits, so my ordinal value in this enum isn't really important. 
In other words, it doesn't matter how I list my constants in this enum, 
so I'm just choosing alphabetical order. 
I've added a semicolon after the last constant, 
because I'm going to include an additional method on this enum. 
Next, I want to add a public method, _getImage_, that just returns 
the ascii character to print for each suit. 
I'm just going to set up a char array of those values 
in the same order as my constants, then index that array by the ordinal value. 
That completes the enum.

For the card record itself, I'll first override the _toString_ method, 
so I'll insert an override. 
I'll set up a local variable, index, which in all cases will be 1, 
unless my card is a 10, which is the only case 
where I want two digits to be retrieved. 
I'll retrieve either the first number 
or letter from the face field of the card, 
or just 10 if it's 10. 
I return a formatted string which is the number or face card abbreviation,
the suit character, which I can get from the get Image method I created, 
and then the rank of the card. 
Now, I want a bunch of public static methods on this class, 
to help anyone to build a deck, or printing out a list of cards.

```java  
public static Card getNumericCard(Suit suit, int cardNumber) {

    if (cardNumber > 1 && cardNumber < 11) {
        return new Card(suit, String.valueOf(cardNumber), cardNumber - 2);
    }
    System.out.println("Invalid Numeric card selected");
    return null;
}
```

I'll start with the method to return a standard numeric card, 
so it'll be a public static, and the return type is Card. 
I'm calling it _getNumericCard_, 
and passing it a specific suit and a cardNumber, 
so this will be a number between 2 and 10, for a standard deck. 
I want to make sure the card number passed is really a number between 2 and 10.
If it is, I'll return a new card instance with the suit passed,
the cardNumber as a string, and a generated rank. 
I want my lowest card to have a rank of zero, 
and since my lowest card is a 2, I'll subtract 2 here. 
Finally, if this method was called with some other number, 
I'll print there was a problem. 
And I'll return null in that case.

```java  
public static Card getFaceCard(Suit suit, char abbrev) {

    int charIndex = "JQKA".indexOf(abbrev);
    if (charIndex > -1) {
        return new Card(suit, "" + abbrev, charIndex + 9);
    }
    System.out.println("Invalid Face card selected");
    return null;
}
```

The next method, _getFaceCard_, is going to be very similar. 
However, instead of taking a card number,
it will take a char, the abbreviation for the face card, 
so J for Jack, Q for Queen, K for King, and A for ace. 
I'll validate that the character passed is one of those four, 
by calling the indexOf method, on a string that has those four characters. 
Now, this card isn't checking for the proper case, 
and you could add that if you wanted your own code to be more robust.
In general, the mechanism for creating a card will be 
in the context of creating a deck, 
so I'm not going to be too worried about bad data passed in here. 
If the index is greater than -1, it's one of the four valid letters. 
And I'll return a new card instance with the suit specified,
the abbreviation passed as a string, and again a generated ranking,
such that a Jack gets the rank of 9, and an Ace gets the highest rank of 12. 
If the code falls through to this point, an invalid character was passed. 
So I'll return null.

```java  
public static List<Card> getStandardDeck() {

    List<Card> deck = new ArrayList<>(52);
    for (Suit suit : Suit.values()) {
        for (int i = 2; i <= 10; i++) {
            deck.add(getNumericCard(suit, i));
        }
        for (char c : new char[]{'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'}) {
            deck.add(getFaceCard(suit, c));
        }
    }
    return deck;
}
```

Our client can call these two methods. 
However, in most normal circumstances, 
they'll be called by the next method,
which returns an array list of cards, 
the standard deck of 52 cards, 
every card unique by suit and face card value.
Not all decks are standard. 
If any of you have played pinochle, 
you'll know there are other variations.
This method again will be public and static, 
it will return a List, 
and I'm going to specifically make a list of Cards,
and the name will be _getStandardDeck_, with no parameters. 
I'll first set up a local variable, again List, 
type argument Card, and I'm calling that deck, 
and assigning a new ArrayList with a capacity of 52, 
since I know this is the size of my deck. 
At the end of this method, I'll return this deck.
What I need to do between those two statements is 
add the 52 cards.
I'll loop through my enum values, my suits, 
using the values method on enum, and a for loop. 
For each suit, I'm going to create a set of numeric cards, 
then a set of face cards.
My first nested loop will loop from 2 to 10.
And I'll add the card I get back from calling the _getNumericCard_ method, 
passing it the current suit and the loop variable, _i_. 
My next nested loop will loop through the four characters 
that represent my face cards, J, Q, K and A. 
I'll add the card, calling _getFaceCard_ to get an instance. 
That method will give me a deck of 52 cards, in four suits,
first the cards 2 through 10, ranked from zero to eight, 
then the face cards, Jack through Ace, ranked from 9 to 13. 
I want to include a couple of overloaded printDeck methods next.

```java  
public static void printDeck(List<Card> deck) {
    printDeck(deck, "Current Deck", 4);
}

public static void printDeck(List<Card> deck, String description, int rows) {

    System.out.println("---------------------------");
    if (description != null) {
        System.out.println(description);
    }
    int cardsInRow = deck.size() / rows;
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        int startIndex = i * cardsInRow;
        int endIndex = startIndex + cardsInRow;
        deck.subList(startIndex, endIndex).forEach(c -> System.out.print(c + " "));
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

These are public static void, named printDeck and take a List, 
with a type argument of Card. 
But the first one also takes a description, 
and the number of rows desired to use to print out the deck.
I'll always print a separator line of dashes to help see different outputs. 
If the description passed isn't null. 
I'll print that out on its own line.
I want a local variable, cards in row, 
which is the number of cards to be printed on any one row, 
which is the deck size divided by rows, 
If I passed 4 as rows, and my deck was a standard one, 
I'd get 13 cards in four rows this way. 
I loop from zero to one less than the rows. 
The starting index will be _i_, times the cards in the row, 
so for the first iteration this will be 0, 
for the second (in a standard deck), it'll be 13, 
then 26 and so on. 
The ending index is just the starting index plus 
the cards in the row. 
Next, I want to use the start and end index 
to get a sublist of my deck, 
then I chain the forEach method to the sublist, 
printing each card on the same line,
separated by a space.
After each row of cards, I want a line break. 
The overloaded version of this method will only have a list of cards,
and will call this method with some defaults. 
So I'm just going to call the overloaded version,
with CurrentDeck as the header, and in four rows. 
And actually, I'll move this overloaded version of the print deck method 
above the other one by cutting and pasting it.
So that's my setup. 
I'll test that this code works in the Main class:

```java  
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Card> deck = Card.getStandardDeck();
        Card.printDeck(deck);
    }
}
```

Simply by calling the _getStandardDeck_ method on the **Card** class, 
assigning it to a variable, 
and then calling printDeck on the Card class as well. 
Running this code:

```java  
---------------------------
Current Deck
2â™£(0) 3â™£(1) 4â™£(2) 5â™£(3) 6â™£(4) 7â™£(5) 8â™£(6) 9â™£(7) 10â™£(8) Jâ™£(9) Qâ™£(10) Kâ™£(11) Aâ™£(12)
2â™¦(0) 3â™¦(1) 4â™¦(2) 5â™¦(3) 6â™¦(4) 7â™¦(5) 8â™¦(6) 9â™¦(7) 10â™¦(8) Jâ™¦(9) Qâ™¦(10) Kâ™¦(11) Aâ™¦(12)
2â™¥(0) 3â™¥(1) 4â™¥(2) 5â™¥(3) 6â™¥(4) 7â™¥(5) 8â™¥(6) 9â™¥(7) 10â™¥(8) Jâ™¥(9) Qâ™¥(10) Kâ™¥(11) Aâ™¥(12)
2â™ (0) 3â™ (1) 4â™ (2) 5â™ (3) 6â™ (4) 7â™ (5) 8â™ (6) 9â™ (7) 10â™ (8) Jâ™ (9) Qâ™ (10) Kâ™ (11) Aâ™ (12)
```
        
You can see why I wanted to print my deck by rows, 
it's easier to see all the cards, 
and when I create a standard deck, 
they're ordered by suit and rank as you can see. 
Ok, so that's the setup. 

It's important to understand that the **Collections** class 
is **not** the **Collections Framework**. 
The framework contains many interfaces and implemented classes,
as well as helper classes, which this Collections class is just one example. 
At one time, Java had interfaces,
but no support for static or default methods on them, 
so useful methods were packaged in these helper classes. 
Some of these methods have since been implemented 
on the interfaces themselves, 
but there's still some functionality on the Collections class 
you might find useful. 
I'll examine some of these in code, 
and compare them to the methods on the interfaces now available.

In the last lecture, I created some code I'll be using in this lecture, 
and a couple of the ones that follow. 
I'll briefly discuss it here, 
for those of you who decided to skip that walk through.

![image09](https://github.com/korhanertancakmak/JAVA/blob/master/src/Udemy/JavaProgrammingTimBuchalka/NewVersion/Section_11_Collections/images/image08.png?raw=true)

This code has **Card**, a record, with a nested enum, 
named **Suit**, declared in it. 
**Suit** is either a **Club**, **Diamond**, **Heart** or **Spade**, 
and this enum has a helper function, _getImage_, 
that returns a printable character value for that suit. 
I overrode the _toString_ method on **Card**, 
to print that character along with what I call the face, 
or face value of the card, so 2 through 10, 
or **Jack**, **Queen**, **King**, or **Ace**. 
Each card will also have a rank, 
starting with 0 for the lowest card. 
In a standard deck, the lowest card, a two, is 0, 
because an **Ace** is usually the highest value card, 
though an ace can represent a one sometimes. 
The **Card** has static helper functions 
I'll be using in the code in this lecture, one
to get an instance of a numeric card, 
one to get an instance of a face card. 
In addition, I can get a list of cards,
that represents a standard deck of cards. 
And there are functions to print the deck of cards.
This set up will give us lots of opportunities, 
to test out the many methods on **java.util.Collections**. 
I want to start out by exploring some methods on collections
for populating a list.

```java  
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Card> deck = Card.getStandardDeck();
        Card.printDeck(deck);

        Card[] cardArray = new Card[13];
        Card aceOfHearts = Card.getFaceCard(Card.Suit.HEART, 'A');
        Arrays.fill(cardArray, aceOfHearts);
        Card.printDeck(Arrays.asList(cardArray), "Aces of Hearts", 1);
    }
}
```

I want to start out by exploring some methods 
on collections for populating a list. 
Before I start, I'll first use a method I've shown you before, 
on the Arrays helper class, called _fill_, to fill an array.
I'm going to create an array of Cards, 
just for one suit, to start out, 
so I'll create an empty array of 13 Cards.
I'll generate an ace of Hearts card using the static _getFaceCard_ method. 
The thing to note here is that **Suit** is a nested enum inside **Card**, 
so for me to access it from this Main class, 
I have to use the Card type as a qualifier to the enum type name, **Suit**. 
Next, I'll call the _fill_ method on the **Arrays** class, 
passing the ace of hearts card. 
And I'll print that out, passing my array as a list backed by an array. 
I'll call the overloaded version of _printDeck_,
so I can pass a description, 
and I just want that printed out in a single row. 
Running this code,

```java  
---------------------------
Aces of Hearts
Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12)
```

You can see the output. 
I have an array of 13 cards, 
all filled with the same kind of card, 
an ace of hearts, 
and aces have a rank of 12.
I'm reviewing this method on arrays 
because I wanted to also show you that 
the Collections class has a _fill_ method 
that seems very similar,
so I want to look at that in comparison.

```java  
List<Card> cards = new ArrayList<>(52);
Collections.fill(cards, aceOfHearts);
System.out.println(cards);
System.out.println("cards.size() = " + cards.size());
```

This method takes a list, and an element. 
I'll create a new array list of cards, just calling it cards,
and specify that it can hold 52 cards, 
which is the number of cards in a standard deck. 
I'll next call fill on the Collections class this time, 
and pass it my card list, as well as the _aceOfHearts_ card. 
I'll print the list, simply by passing it to _System.out.println_ this time. 
And I'll print the size of the list.
This method, _fill_, looks a lot like **Arrays.fill**, 
so you'd expect to get an array of 52 cards back, 
all aces of hearts. 
Running this code though,

```java  
[]
cards.size() = 0
```

It shows that's not what really happens. 
Instead, the list is empty, 
and the size of the list is zero. 
When I initialize the ArrayList, passing it 52, 
it just sets the capacity to 52. 
It doesn't populate the list with elements.
Unlike an array, the list isn't populated with 52 null references, for example. 
Using _fill_ here, on the **Collections** class would fill 
the list (if it's size were greater than zero), 
meaning it would replace every element with the element passed to the method. 
The **Collections.fill** method doesn't add elements, 
so if my list is empty, it stays empty.
How can I fill this list with some default value? 
The Collections class offers us some alternatives.

```java  
List<Card> acesOfHearts = Collections.nCopies(13, aceOfHearts);
Card.printDeck(acesOfHearts, "Aces of Hearts", 1);
```

One of these methods is called _nCopies_ 
which creates a new list with the number of elements 
you specify as the first argument, 
filling it with the element you pass as the second argument. 
First, I'll set up another local variable,
and call it _acesOfHearts_, 
and assign that to the call to **Collections.nCopies**, 
passing 13, and the card I create earlier, _aceOfHearts_. 
And I'll use _printDeck_, so I get a line separator and a header, 
but I'll print these cards in a single row.

```java  
---------------------------
Aces of Hearts
Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12)
```
                
Like the **Array.fill** example, 
I now have 13 aces of hearts in this new list. 
I'm going to copy those last two lines, 
and paste a copy directly below that.

```java  
Card kingOfClubs = Card.getFaceCard(Card.Suit.CLUB, 'K');
List<Card> kingsOfClubs = Collections.nCopies(13, kingOfClubs);
Card.printDeck(kingsOfClubs, "Kings of Clubs", 1);
```

Before I change anything, 
I want to first add a new card, before these two statements. 
I want to create a king of clubs, so I'll call get face card, 
passing it **Card.suit.CLUB**, and the character K. 
Now, I'll change the list name from aces of hearts,
to king of clubs on the first line.
I'll change the card passed to _nCopies_ on the second statement
from _aceOfHearts_ to _kingOfClubs_. 
Finally, I'll change the call to print deck, 
again replacing _acesOfHearts_ with _kingsOfClubs_,
and also specifying King of Clubs as the descriptive header. 
Ok, running that,

```java  
---------------------------
Kings of Clubs
Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11)
```

I now have a second list with just king of clubs. 
Next, I want to populate my full deck with some of these. 
Like **List**, **Collections** includes an _addAll_ method.

```java  
Collections.addAll(cards, cardArray);
Card.printDeck(cards, "Card Collection with Aces added", 1); 
```

Its first argument is the list I want to add elements to. 
The second argument is for the elements to be added,
but unlike list's _addAll_ method, 
this is a variable argument of elements to be added. 
The difference is that List's _addAll_ method takes a collection of elements to be added. 
Remember, my _cards_ list is still empty with an initial capacity of 52 cards.
I'll call **Collections.addAll**, 
passing it my _cards_ list, 
and I'll just simply pass my cardArray, of acesOfHearths, to that. 
And then I'll print out the _cards_ deck. 
Running this code,

```java  
---------------------------
Card Collection with Aces added
Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12)
```
            
You can see that my _cards_ list has the same cards now 
as the aces of hearts list. 
For good measure, what do you think happens, 
If I just execute _addAll_ on cards, 
passing it this array? 
Let me add that code, right after the _Collections.addAll_ method. 

```java  
Collections.addAll(cards, cardArray);
Card.printDeck(cards, "Card Collection with Aces added", 1); 
//cards.addAll(cardArray);
```

**cards.addAll(cardArray)** doesn't compile 
because you can't pass an array to the _addAll_ method on **List**.
You can pass a collection, or another list, 
which is why you'll often see me using _List.Of_, or _Array.asList_, 
as part of that method. 
I'll comment that last line.

Next, I want to examine the copy method on **java.util.Collections**. 
First, I'll comment last two statements. 
I'll next make a call to _Collections.copy_, 
passing it my now empty cards list, 
and the _kingsOfClubs_ list, 
which had 13 king of clubs cards in it. 
And then I'll print that out by calling print deck. 

```java  
Collections.copy(cards, kingsOfClubs);
Card.printDeck(cards, "Card Collection with Kings copied", 1);
```

The copy method on collections takes two arguments,
the first is the destination of the copied elements, 
and here I'm passing my _cards_ list, 
which I want to be my full deck. 
The second argument is the elements to be copied, 
and I'm passing the kings of clubs list. 
You'd expect this to copy the elements in kings of clubs to cards, 
so let me run this.

```java  
Exception in thread in "main" java.lang.IndexOutOfBounds Exception Create breakpoint: Source does not fit in destination
```

You can see I've got an error _Source does not fit in destination_. 
This is similar to the problem I had earlier with the fill method on Collections. 
My card list is empty. 
Remember I commented on the _addAll_ method, 
so nothing has filled or populated,
or added elements yet, to my card deck, 
so its size is still 0. 
You can't use this copy method if the number of elements 
in your current list is less than the number of elements 
in the source list (cards = 0, kingsOfClubs = 13).
I'll uncomment out those two lines of code above, 
so cards will have 13 aces of hearts in it,
before I use the copy method. 
And now running that code,

```java  
---------------------------
Card Collection with Kings copied
Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11)
```

You can see my aces in the card list, were replaced with kings. 
What happens if my destination has more elements than the source? 
Let's add some more cards.  

```java  
Collections.addAll(cards, cardArray);
Collections.addAll(cards, cardArray);
Card.printDeck(cards, "Card Collection with Aces added", 1); 
//cards.addAll(cardArray);

Collections.copy(cards, kingsOfClubs);
Card.printDeck(cards, "Card Collection with Kings copied", 1);
```

I'm just going to copy _Collections.addAll_ statement, 
pasting a copy right below it, so that we get 26 aces added.
I'm also going to change the call to print deck, to print on two rows:

```java  
Card.printDeck(cards, "Card Collection with Aces added", 2);
Card.printDeck(cards, "Card Collection with Kings copied", 2);
```

So it's easier to read the output. And running this,

```java  
---------------------------
Card Collection with Aces added
Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12)
Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12)
        ---------------------------
Card Collection with Kings copied
Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11)
Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¥(12)
```
            
You can see it only copied over 13 elements, replacing the first 13 aces with kings. 
What I want you to understand here is that 
this method copies elements from one list to another 
it doesn't return a copy of your list. 
Elements are being assigned to the existing destination list, vs. 
a copy of the list being made. 
If you want a full list copy, you'd use the **List.copy**method, 
so let me revisit that method real quickly for you here.

```java  
cards = List.copyOf(kingsOfClubs);
Card.printDeck(cards, "List Copy of Kings", 1);
```

I'll reassign cards to the result of List.copyOf, 
passing it my kingsOfClubs list. 
And I'll print my _cards_ list in a single row.

```java  
---------------------------
List Copy of Kings
Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11) Kâ™£(11)
```

This gives us the result, which is the same as the list kingsOfClubs. 
This method is a true copy, though it's important to remember that 
this method returns an unmodifiable list. 
If you needed a modifiable copy of the list, 
you'd make a call to the copy of method, 
and pass it to a List constructor, 
or use _addAll,_ for example. 

Now, I'm going to pick up the discussion 
to look at another method on collections,
that's fun to use when you have a deck of cards, 
and that's shuffle. 
I've already got a variable setup, called deck,
that contains my standard deck of cards.
I'll comment these at the top of the main method, 
and copy-paste it right below. 
Now, I want to shuffle my deck.

```java  
List<Card> deck = Card.getStandardDeck();
Card.printDeck(deck);
```

Now, I want to shuffle my deck. 
I could write some random function 
to do it for me, but even easier, 
I can use the shuffle method on Collections. 

```java  
Collections.shuffle(deck);
Card.printDeck(deck, "Shuffled Deck" , 4);
```

And I'll print my deck with a header 
of **Shuffled Deck**, and in four rows. 
Running this code:

```java  
---------------------------
Shuffled Deck
Jâ™¥(9) 6â™ (4) 5â™¦(3) 2â™ (0) 9â™£(7) 5â™ (3) Jâ™¦(9) Qâ™£(10) Aâ™¦(12) 8â™¥(6) Aâ™£(12) 10â™ (8) Kâ™ (11)
2â™£(0) Aâ™ (12) 3â™¦(1) 3â™£(1) Qâ™ (10) 9â™¥(7) 2â™¥(0) 6â™¥(4) 7â™¦(5) 8â™ (6) Aâ™¥(12) 5â™¥(3) 10â™¥(8)
Qâ™¦(10) 4â™ (2) 10â™£(8) Kâ™¥(11) Jâ™ (9) 8â™£(6) Jâ™£(9) 8â™¦(6) 9â™¦(7) 3â™ (1) 10â™¦(8) Kâ™¦(11) 9â™ (7)
4â™¦(2) Kâ™£(11) 5â™£(3) 6â™£(4) 2â™¦(0) 3â™¥(1) 7â™¥(5) Qâ™¥(10) 4â™£(2) 7â™£(5) 6â™¦(4) 4â™¥(2) 7â™ (5)
```
                
You can see that my deck got shuffled. 
This is a useful method if you're writing a card game certainly, 
and a good tool in your arsenal, 
if you ever want to randomize a list of existing elements for some reason. 
Another method is the _reverse_ method, 
and it's easier to see what that's doing after the _shuffle_ method, 
so let me add that next.

```java  
Collections.reverse(deck);
Card.printDeck(deck, "Reversed Deck of Cards:", 4);
```

I'll call the _reverse_ method on Collections, 
passing it my deck. 
I'll print the deck again, 
after this method. 
Running this code:

```java  
---------------------------
Reversed Deck of Cards:
7â™ (5) 4â™¥(2) 6â™¦(4) 7â™£(5) 4â™£(2) Qâ™¥(10) 7â™¥(5) 3â™¥(1) 2â™¦(0) 6â™£(4) 5â™£(3) Kâ™£(11) 4â™¦(2)
9â™ (7) Kâ™¦(11) 10â™¦(8) 3â™ (1) 9â™¦(7) 8â™¦(6) Jâ™£(9) 8â™£(6) Jâ™ (9) Kâ™¥(11) 10â™£(8) 4â™ (2) Qâ™¦(10)
10â™¥(8) 5â™¥(3) Aâ™¥(12) 8â™ (6) 7â™¦(5) 6â™¥(4) 2â™¥(0) 9â™¥(7) Qâ™ (10) 3â™£(1) 3â™¦(1) Aâ™ (12) 2â™£(0)
Kâ™ (11) 10â™ (8) Aâ™£(12) 8â™¥(6) Aâ™¦(12) Qâ™£(10) Jâ™¦(9) 5â™ (3) 9â™£(7) 2â™ (0) 5â™¦(3) 6â™ (4) Jâ™¥(9)
```

You see that this method simply reverses the order of the elements. 
It doesn't reorder it first, 
so the first element in the shuffled deck, _Jâ™¥(9)_, 
becomes the last element in reversed deck, and vice versa. 
Since I mentioned sorting, let's talk about that next. 
You may run across legacy code that uses Collections to sort. 
There are two flavors much like the _sort_ method on the **List** interface. 
One requires your elements in the list to implement Comparable, 
and one doesn't. 
Right now, I'll look at the one that does not. 
The _collections.sort_ method takes your list 
as the first argument.
If your elements implement Comparable, 
that would be it. 
But if they don't, or you want to force an alternative sort,
you can pass a **Comparator**, as we've seen in previous lectures. 
My Card record doesn't implement Comparable, 
and let's say, for whatever reason, I don't want it to.

Instead, I'll sort with a Comparator, 
which I'll set up as a local variable, 
because I think I may want to use 
this sort in different scenarios.
Hopefully you remember the easy way of using 
the convenience methods on Comparator, 
which let me do this.

```java  
var sortingAlgorithm = Comparator.comparing(Card::rank).thenComparing(Card::suit);
Collections.sort(deck, sortingAlgorithm);
Card.printDeck(deck, "Standard Deck sorted by rank, suit", 13);
```

I'll call the _comparing_ method on Comparator, 
passing it a method reference for Card rank. 
I'll chain the _thenComparing_ method to that, 
this time passing **Card::suit**. 
You can see, by looking at IntelliJ hints, 
I'm getting a **Comparator<Card>** back 
from those chained methods. 
Now I can pass my _sortingAlgorithm_ variable 
to the **Collections.sort** method, 
so first pass the deck, then sorting algorithm. 
I'll call **Card.printDeck**, 
with a header specifying how the deck is sorted, 
but this time I want to print 13 rows. 
You'll see why in a minute. 
Running this code:

```java  
---------------------------
Standard Deck sorted by rank, suit
2â™£(0) 2â™¦(0) 2â™¥(0) 2â™ (0)
3â™£(1) 3â™¦(1) 3â™¥(1) 3â™ (1)
4â™£(2) 4â™¦(2) 4â™¥(2) 4â™ (2)
5â™£(3) 5â™¦(3) 5â™¥(3) 5â™ (3)
6â™£(4) 6â™¦(4) 6â™¥(4) 6â™ (4)
7â™£(5) 7â™¦(5) 7â™¥(5) 7â™ (5)
8â™£(6) 8â™¦(6) 8â™¥(6) 8â™ (6)
9â™£(7) 9â™¦(7) 9â™¥(7) 9â™ (7)
10â™£(8) 10â™¦(8) 10â™¥(8) 10â™ (8)
Jâ™£(9) Jâ™¦(9) Jâ™¥(9) Jâ™ (9)
Qâ™£(10) Qâ™¦(10) Qâ™¥(10) Qâ™ (10)
Kâ™£(11) Kâ™¦(11) Kâ™¥(11) Kâ™ (11)
Aâ™£(12) Aâ™¦(12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™ (12)
```

You can see my cards are now ordered by the rank 
(and therefore their face value), 
from lowest to highest. 
This view is a little easier to see, 
that a standard deck of cards contains a two of every suit, 
and so on. 
Of course, I could have just called sort on Deck, 
and passed it that sortingAlgorithm. 
You might be asking which sort method you should use. 
I'll point out that IntelliJ has flagged this method in my code,
and if I hover over that, 
we get the answer to that question,
**Collections.sort** could be replaced with **List.sort**. 
In fact, if I control click on sort, 
and bring up the declaration of that method, 
you'll see that it simply calls **list.sort** anyway. 
When the sort method was added to the **List** interface, 
the underlying code on the **Collections** class
was changed to leverage it to support backwards 
compatibility of code that still uses the **Collections** class sort. 
In other words, there's no need to rush out 
and change the legacy code 
if you run across code still using **Collections.sort**. 
I won't change it in this code, but in the future, 
I'll be using **List**'s _sort_ method.

```java  
Collections.reverse(deck);
Card.printDeck(deck, "Sorted by rank, suit reversed:", 13);
```

Next, I'll call **collections.reverse** again 
so that my cards are sorted by highest to lowest rank. 
And I'll print that again, using 13 rows. 
Running that code:

```java  
---------------------------
Sorted by rank, suit reversed:
Aâ™ (12) Aâ™¥(12) Aâ™¦(12) Aâ™£(12)
Kâ™ (11) Kâ™¥(11) Kâ™¦(11) Kâ™£(11)
Qâ™ (10) Qâ™¥(10) Qâ™¦(10) Qâ™£(10)
Jâ™ (9) Jâ™¥(9) Jâ™¦(9) Jâ™£(9)
10â™ (8) 10â™¥(8) 10â™¦(8) 10â™£(8)
9â™ (7) 9â™¥(7) 9â™¦(7) 9â™£(7)
8â™ (6) 8â™¥(6) 8â™¦(6) 8â™£(6)
7â™ (5) 7â™¥(5) 7â™¦(5) 7â™£(5)
6â™ (4) 6â™¥(4) 6â™¦(4) 6â™£(4)
5â™ (3) 5â™¥(3) 5â™¦(3) 5â™£(3)
4â™ (2) 4â™¥(2) 4â™¦(2) 4â™£(2)
3â™ (1) 3â™¥(1) 3â™¦(1) 3â™£(1)
2â™ (0) 2â™¥(0) 2â™¦(0) 2â™£(0)
```

You'll see the standard deck sorted by rank,  
and the suit reversed.

```java  
List<Card> kings = new ArrayList<>(deck.subList(4, 8));
Card.printDeck(kings, "Kings in deck", 1);

List<Card> tens = new ArrayList<>(deck.subList(16, 20));
Card.printDeck(tens, "Tens in deck", 1);
```

The next couple of methods let you 
compare sub lists to full lists. 
I'll carve out a couple of smaller lists 
from my standard deck here, using list's sublist method, 
and passing them to a new array list constructor. 
My First sublist will be kings. 
Since my deck is ordered, 
I know my kings are in the second row of my last output, 
so the starting index of the sublist is 4, 
and the ending index is 8, 
which is an exclusive index.
And I'll print this new list in a single row. 
I'm going to copy and paste those two statements. 
I'll change kings to tens, and the indices used 
from 4 to 8, to 16 and 20, 
because this should be a list of my 10 cards. 
Ok, running that:

```java  
---------------------------
Kings in deck
Kâ™ (11) Kâ™¥(11) Kâ™¦(11) Kâ™£(11)
---------------------------
Tens in deck
10â™ (8) 10â™¥(8) 10â™¦(8) 10â™£(8)
```
                
You can see I have two lists, one with kings, 
and the other with tens.
Now I can use these lists 
to test a couple of other methods on Collections.

```java  
Collections.shuffle(deck);
int subListIndex = Collections.indexOfSubList(deck, tens);
System.out.println("sublist index for tens = " + subListIndex);
System.out.println("Contains = " + deck.containsAll(tens));
```

The first is _indexOfSubList_ that returns an integer 
if it finds a sublist in the collection passed to it. 
The first argument, I'll make the deck, will be searched. 
The second argument, I'll make that the tens list. 
_subListIndex_ will return an integer if tens are found in the deck, 
or a **-1** if it wasn't. 
And I'll print the result of that method call.
Running that:

```java  
---(same)
sublist index for tens = 16
```

You can see this method told me 
where I could find the sublist in the full list, 
starting at index 16, which we already knew. 
However, this method could be useful 
if you ever needed to identify 
if some portion of a list already exists in a bigger list.
Unlike _contains_, the elements in the sublist 
must be contiguously found in the full list.
I'll add _contains_ here next.
I'll print contains equals, 
then call _deck.containsAll_, and pass tens there.
Running that:

```java  
---(same)
Contains = true
```
                
You can see I got the result. 
So the list contains all the elements in the sublist. 
Now, I want to shuffle the cards 
before executing these two tests, 
so I'll add that, _Collections.shuffle_ 
and pass it deck, and running that:

```java  
sublist index for tens = -1
Contains = true
```

You can see the sublist index is -1, 
meaning the sublist wasn't found in the full list, 
but contains all, is still returning true, 
so it found the four elements. 
I'll revert to that last change, 
and comment the call to shuffle. 
Have you noticed that IntelliJ is highlighting _containsAll_, 
and if I hover over that, 
it gives me the message 
that _containsAll_ might have a poor performance.
The suggestion is to wrap the deck in a HashSet constructor. 
Don't worry about this suggestion right now. 
Our deck only has 52 cards, 
and I'm only showing you the containsAll method, 
in comparison to the index of subList method. 
But this hint is a good teaser of things to come. 
After I finish covering the Collections methods,
we'll be talking about Sets and HashSets.

```java  
boolean disjoint = Collections.disjoint(deck, tens);
System.out.println("disjoint = " + disjoint);
```

The next method I want to look at is the _disjoint_ method. 
This method returns true if the two lists have no elements
in common. 
This method takes two collections, 
and returns true if the two collections don't share elements, 
or false if they do.
I'll call this method, passing it my deck, and tens sublist,
and I'll assign the result to a boolean variable I'll call disjoint. 
And I'll print the value of disjoint. 
Running this code:

```java  
---(same)
disjoint = false
```
                
You see that disjoint is false. 
In this code, I'm comparing the full list with a just tens list, 
and since ten lists are really just a sublist of deck, 
we know there's elements in common, 
so they aren't disjoint collections.
Whether the tens are contiguous or not, 
disjoint should return false, 
meaning it found at least 
one of the elements in tens in the _cards_ list.

```java  
boolean disjoint2 = Collections.disjoint(kings, tens);
System.out.println("disjoint = " + disjoint2);
```

I'll copy and paste those two statements, 
I'll change the name of my variable to _disjoint2_ 
in that first statement, and change _deck_ to my _kings_ list. 
And in the second statement, 
I'll change disjoint to disjoint2 in both cases. 
Running this code:

```java  
---(same)
disjoint = true
```
                
You see that _disjoint2_ is true, 
meaning _kings_ and _tens_ don't have any elements in common.
Now that we've covered _shuffle_, _reverse_, _sort_, 
_indexOfSubList_, and _disjoint_. 

Again, like the **Arrays** class 
that gave us a _binarySearch_ method for arrays,
the Collections method supports a binary search method for lists. 
Both methods require the elements to be sorted first,
and neither guarantees what index is returned 
if you've got duplicates. 
The _binarySearch_ method on Collections is
overloaded like the _sort_ method. 
I can pass a List of Comparable elements, 
or I can pass a list with a separate Comparator,
which should match the way the elements are sorted. 
Both methods take an element, the element that will be searched for, 
which should be the same type 
as the elements in the List passed. 
I'll use this method on my deck of cards next.

```java  
deck.sort(sortingAlgorithm);
Card tenOfHearts = Card.getNumericCard(Card.Suit.HEART, 10);
int foundIndex = Collections.binarySearch(deck, tenOfHearts, sortingAlgorithm);
System.out.println("foundIndex = " + foundIndex);
System.out.println("foundIndex = " + deck.indexOf(tenOfHearts));
System.out.println(deck.get(foundIndex));
```

First, I want to create a ten of hearts card, 
which will be the card I want to search for in my deck. 
I'll set up a ten of hearts variable, 
and assign it what I get 
from the static method **Card.getNumericCard**
with Hearts as the suit, and the face value of 10. 
Now, I want a local variable, an int, 
which I'll call _foundIndex_, 
and assign that the result of calling 
binary search on the **Collections** class. 
I'm going to pass my deck, a list, 
and this new tenOfHearts. 
Lastly, I'll pass the sorting algorithm 
I set up earlier in this method, 
which I used to sort with, 
and I called that sorting Algorithm. 
Print the resulting index.
Print the matched element at that index.
However, running this code gives me an error.

```java  
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException Create breakpoint : Index -53 out of bounds for length 52
```
            
The index that came back was -53, not -1, 
but it still means the ten of hearts wasn't found. 
Can you guess why? 
If you scroll up and review my code, 
you'll notice that I reversed the original sort. 
Now, I'm attempting to use binary search on a list 
that isn't sorted the way I specified. 
This is important.
Your list must be sorted 
before you can execute binarySearch on it. 
If I'm passing a comparator, 
my list has to be sorted that way before executing this method. 
I can fix this by calling sort again on my deck 
with the same comparator I passed to the binary search. 
I'll insert **deck.sort(sortingAlgorithm)** statement 
before I create the _tenOfHearts_ card. 
Re-running my code now,

```java  
---(same)
foundIndex = 34 
10â™¥(8)
```
                
I get a found index of 34, 
and sure enough, it prints out the 10 of hearts element 
in the deck of cards, which is good, 
since that's the card I was looking for. 
Remember, you can use List's index of method 
to do this same thing, without the list being required 
to be in sorted order. 
The _contains_ method on **List**, 
uses the _IndexOf_ method to return its result as well. 
Let me show you the _indexOf_ method here for comparison. 
I'll add another println statement by calling 
_deck.indexOf_, passing it _tenOfHearts_ variable. 
Running that:

```java  
---(same)
foundIndex = 34
foundIndex = 34
10â™¥(8)
```

You can see that the found index is still 34, 
when using this method on the _cards_ list. 
But now let's see what happens, 
if I comment out that the first statement, _deck.sort_ there. 
Running this code now:

```java  
---(same)
foundIndex = -53
foundIndex = 17
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException Create breakpoint : Index -53 out of bounds for length 52
```
            
You can see that the found index of the tenOfHearts 
is 17 in the second instance. 
The _indexOf_ method on **List** can find 
the ten of hearts in my list, sorted or not. 
The _binarySearch_ gives us a result, 
but not on that is reliable, 
and that last statement again gives me an exception,
when I try to retrieve an element with that _index = -53_. 
I'll revert to that last change,
where I commented out the sort, 
so this code compiles and runs.
Ok, then, you might be asking which method should you use? 
The basic rule of thumb is, 
if your lists contain a small number of elements, 
or if your list is unsorted or may contain duplicates, 
then using the _indexOf_ method, or its cohort, 
the _lastIndexOf_ method, will provide better performance. 
If your list is already sorted 
and contains a large number of elements, 
then the binary search method may provide performance improvements.

```java  
Card tenOfClubs = Card.getNumericCard(Card.Suit.CLUB, 10);
Collections.replaceAll(deck, tenOfClubs, tenOfHearts);
Card.printDeck(deck.subList(32, 36), "Tens row", 1);
```

Moving on, I want to examine just a couple more methods 
in the **Collections** class. 
First, this class has a _replaceAll_ method 
like the **List** interface. 
You'll remember the _replaceAll_ method on **List**, 
allowed us to write a function, a lambda expression 
to do a global replacement of all elements. 
The method on this **collections** class is 
much more limited, because it requires you 
to replace one or more instances with another. 
I'll use the _replaceAll_ method of Collections 
to replace the _tenOfClubs_ with a _tenOfHearts_ in my deck. 
My tens row is now lower in the list, 
since I re-sorted it, so I'm using elements 32 through 36, 
just to print out the tens in the list.

```java  
---------------------------
Tens row
10â™¥(8) 10â™¦(8) 10â™¥(8) 10â™ (8)
```

The output shows that I now have 2 tensOfHearts. 
This method will replace more than one element 
if it finds multiple matches.

```java  
Collections.replaceAll(deck, tenOfHearts, tenOfClubs);
Card.printDeck(deck.subList(32, 36), "Tens row", 1);
```

I'll copy those last two statements, 
and pass a copy below. 
This time, I want the tenOfHearts as the first argument,
and the tenOfClubs as the second argument, 
so this is doing the _reverse_ now, 
replacing any 10s of hearts with a tensOfClubs.
Running that:

```java  
---------------------------
Tens row
10â™£(8) 10â™¦(8) 10â™£(8) 10â™ (8)
```
                
You can see it replaced both 10s of hearts 
with 10s of clubs.
Now, IntelliJ wants our attention 
on both of those _replaceAll_ methods, 
and it's indicating that 
_the result of **Collections.replaceAll()** is ignored_. 
That's because this method returns a boolean value, 
true if the list was really changed, 
meaning one or more elements was replaced, 
or false if not.

```java  
if (Collections.replaceAll(deck, tenOfHearts, tenOfClubs)) {
    System.out.println("Tens of hearts replaced with tens of clubs");
} else {
    System.out.println("No tens of hearts found in the list");
}
```

I'll add one more call to this method, 
duplicating the call previously,
but wrapping it in an if statement. 
If the method returns true, I'll print that cards were replaced, 
otherwise, I'll print that no matching tens of hearts were found. 
Running this code:

```java  
---(same)
No tens of hearts found in the list
```
                
You can see my output, no tens of hearts found in the list. 
That's because I replaced them all, in the _replace_ call
just previous to this call, with tens of clubs. 
I'll leave those other warnings from IntelliJ. 
You should continue to pay attention to any warnings you see, 
since IntelliJ has had a lot more time 
to learn the rules than you have.
I will sometimes purposely ignore these warnings, 
as I am showing you the ropes, 
but let me encourage you to trust and use IntelliJ's suggestions,
while you're learning on your own.

```java  
System.out.println("Ten of Clubs Cards = " + Collections.frequency(deck, tenOfClubs));
```

Another interesting function is the frequency method, 
which allows you to check for duplicates in your collection.
I'll make a call to this method, directly in a println statement. 
I'll pass it my deck of cards, and the _ten of clubs_ cards. 
Running this:

```java  
---(same)
Ten of Clubs Cards = 2
```
            
I get that two tens of clubs were found in my list.

```java  
System.out.println("Best Card = " + Collections.max(deck, sortingAlgorithm));
System.out.println("Worst Card = " + Collections.min(deck, sortingAlgorithm));
```

Collections also give us both _min_ and _max_ methods, 
which take a collection, and will return the last 
or first element. 
Like _sort_ and _binarySearch_,
you can use one of the two overloaded versions, 
the first if your class implements Comparable, 
which I'm purposely not doing for Card. 
The second takes a Comparator, 
and that's the one I'll use here,
passing my sortingAlgorithm variable, 
to each of these methods. 
I'll call these from within a println statement, 
first _max_, passing deck and sorting algorithm. 
And now _min_, again passing deck and sorting algorithm. 
When I run that:

```java  
---(same)
Best Card = Aâ™ (12)
Worst Card = 2â™£(0)
```
            
It identifies the best card as the _ace of spades_, 
and the worst card is a 2 of clubs.

```java  
var sortBySuit = Comparator.comparing(Card::suit).thenComparing(Card::rank);
deck.sort(sortBySuit);
Card.printDeck(deck, "Sorted by Suit, Rank", 4);
```

Finally, let's look at the _rotate_ method. 
First I want to sort my deck by suit, 
and then rank, as it was in the beginning. 
I could just make another call to _getStandardDeck_, 
but instead I'll just create a new Comparator, 
and call sort on deck, and then print that out. 
Running that code:

```java  
---(same)
---------------------------
Sorted by Suit, Rank
2â™£(0) 3â™£(1) 4â™£(2) 5â™£(3) 6â™£(4) 7â™£(5) 8â™£(6) 9â™£(7) 10â™£(8) 10â™£(8) Jâ™£(9) Qâ™£(10) Kâ™£(11)
Aâ™£(12) 2â™¦(0) 3â™¦(1) 4â™¦(2) 5â™¦(3) 6â™¦(4) 7â™¦(5) 8â™¦(6) 9â™¦(7) 10â™¦(8) Jâ™¦(9) Qâ™¦(10) Kâ™¦(11)
Aâ™¦(12) 2â™¥(0) 3â™¥(1) 4â™¥(2) 5â™¥(3) 6â™¥(4) 7â™¥(5) 8â™¥(6) 9â™¥(7) Jâ™¥(9) Qâ™¥(10) Kâ™¥(11) Aâ™¥(12)
2â™ (0) 3â™ (1) 4â™ (2) 5â™ (3) 6â™ (4) 7â™ (5) 8â™ (6) 9â™ (7) 10â™ (8) Jâ™ (9) Qâ™ (10) Kâ™ (11) Aâ™ (12)
```
                
My deck is again sorted by suits, and then rank.

```java  
List<Card> copied = new ArrayList<>(deck.subList(0, 13));
Collections.rotate(copied, 2);
System.out.println("UnRotated: " + deck.subList(0, 13));
System.out.println("Rotated " + 2 + ": " + copied);
```

Now I'll set up an example of using the _rotate_ method.
First I want a copy of the first suit in my deck. 
I'll create a new **List** variable, called _copied_, 
and that will be a new ArrayList. 
I'll pass a call to _deck.sublist_, 
from 0 to 13, to the ArrayList constructor, 
so this should create a list of just my _clubs_ cards.
The rotate method is a lot easier to understand 
if we look at the results while discussing it. 
Call _rotate_, passing it my new list, 
and the number 2. 
Print the _unrotated_ sublist from my deck.
Print the _rotate_ copied list.
Running that:

```java  
---(same)
UnRotated: [2â™£(0), 3â™£(1), 4â™£(2), 5â™£(3), 6â™£(4), 7â™£(5), 8â™£(6), 9â™£(7), 10â™£(8), 10â™£(8), Jâ™£(9), Qâ™£(10), Kâ™£(11)]
Rotated 2: [Qâ™£(10), Kâ™£(11), 2â™£(0), 3â™£(1), 4â™£(2), 5â™£(3), 6â™£(4), 7â™£(5), 8â™£(6), 9â™£(7), 10â™£(8), 10â™£(8), Jâ™£(9)]
```
                
You can see that the last 2 elements in the original list (the first list printed), 
my Queen and King of clubs were moved 
to be the first two elements in the following rotated list.
A positive number passed to this method moves that 
number of elements in the list from the back of the list 
to the front of the list, as you can see here. 
Notice that the order of the elements 
that were rotated is maintained, so Q is still before K, 
in the rotated list.

```java  
copied = new ArrayList<>(deck.subList(0, 13));
Collections.rotate(copied, -2);
System.out.println("UnRotated: " + deck.subList(0, 13));
System.out.println("Rotated " + -2 + ": " + copied);
```

Now I'll try a negative number,
I'll copy those last four statements 
and paste them directly below. 
I'll remove the type, List with Card there,
in front of copied, 
so I'm just re-declaring this list. 
Then I'll change two to -2 on the second 
and fourth lines.
Running this code:

```java  
---(same)
UnRotated: [2â™£(0), 3â™£(1), 4â™£(2), 5â™£(3), 6â™£(4), 7â™£(5), 8â™£(6), 9â™£(7), 10â™£(8), 10â™£(8), Jâ™£(9), Qâ™£(10), Kâ™£(11)]
Rotated 2: [Qâ™£(10), Kâ™£(11), 2â™£(0), 3â™£(1), 4â™£(2), 5â™£(3), 6â™£(4), 7â™£(5), 8â™£(6), 9â™£(7), 10â™£(8), 10â™£(8), Jâ™£(9)]
UnRotated: [2â™£(0), 3â™£(1), 4â™£(2), 5â™£(3), 6â™£(4), 7â™£(5), 8â™£(6), 9â™£(7), 10â™£(8), 10â™£(8), Jâ™£(9), Qâ™£(10), Kâ™£(11)]
Rotated -2: [4â™£(2), 5â™£(3), 6â™£(4), 7â™£(5), 8â™£(6), 9â™£(7), 10â™£(8), 10â™£(8), Jâ™£(9), Qâ™£(10), Kâ™£(11), 2â™£(0), 3â™£(1)]
```

I want you to compare the output from the two different calls to rotate.
In the first instance, 
the last two elements were moved to the start of the list, 
so the King and Ace of clubs were moved to the start of the list.
Using a negative number though,
you can see it moves the elements from the start 
to the end of the list.
Here, the _2_ and _3_ of clubs were rotated to the end of the list. 
Like _shuffle_, and _reverse_, 
it's good to know these methods exist, 
so you don't have to spend time writing your own algorithm 
to do these things.

```java  
copied = new ArrayList<>(deck.subList(0, 13));
for (int i = 0; i < copied.size() / 2; i++) {
    Collections.swap(copied, i, copied.size() - 1 - i);
}
System.out.println("Manual reverse :" + copied);
```

Finally, I want to look at the swap method. 
You'll remember one of the previous challenges had you swap 
characters in a character array, 
reversing the characters in a string. 
Now, I'll show you how to use the swap method 
on the **Collections** class to do something similar. 
I'll reverse the order of my suit of cards. 
Again, I'll make a copy of my first 13 cards, 
the club cards in the deck. 
Hopefully you'll remember that 
when swapping elements to do a full reverse,
you only need to swap half the elements.
My for loop is from 0 to copied size divided by 2.
Passing the copied list,
and an element _i_, which is the for loop parameter, 
and _j_, which is from the first half of my copied list 
to second half into the **Collections.swap**. 
Print out the copied array. 
Running that:

```java  
---(same)
UnRotated: [2â™£(0), 3â™£(1), 4â™£(2), 5â™£(3), 6â™£(4), 7â™£(5), 8â™£(6), 9â™£(7), 10â™£(8), 10â™£(8), Jâ™£(9), Qâ™£(10), Kâ™£(11)]
Rotated -2: [4â™£(2), 5â™£(3), 6â™£(4), 7â™£(5), 8â™£(6), 9â™£(7), 10â™£(8), 10â™£(8), Jâ™£(9), Qâ™£(10), Kâ™£(11), 2â™£(0), 3â™£(1)]
Manual reverse :[Kâ™£(11), Qâ™£(10), Jâ™£(9), 10â™£(8), 10â™£(8), 9â™£(7), 8â™£(6), 7â™£(5), 6â™£(4), 5â™£(3), 4â™£(2), 3â™£(1), 2â™£(0)]
```

You can see I simply reversed the sublist elements.
I could have simply done this by using the reverse method 
on this sublist (UnRotated).

```java  
copied = new ArrayList<>(deck.subList(0, 13));
Collections.reverse(copied);
System.out.println("Using reverse :" + copied);
```

Let me do that for completeness. 
First, I'll copy and paste the array list again. 
And then call **collections.reverse**, passing my copied list, 
print that out.

```java  
---(same)
Using reverse :[Kâ™£(11), Qâ™£(10), Jâ™£(9), 10â™£(8), 10â™£(8), 9â™£(7), 8â™£(6), 7â™£(5), 6â™£(4), 5â™£(3), 4â™£(2), 3â™£(1), 2â™£(0)]
```

And that does the same thing. 
Having access to the swap method allows you 
to have a lot more granularity in the ways you might use it. 
Ok, so those are a lot of the methods on Collections, 
some of which you might find some use for, 
and it's good to know they exist, 
if you might need this kind of functionality. 
Others are better replaced by List's default method, 
under most circumstances. 
This class contains a lot of methods 
for transforming collections into other collection types, 
such as _viewable_, _immutable_, _checkable_, and empty collections,
which I'm not going to review here.
Many of these have been replaced with additional implementations 
in the **Collections** Frameworks, 
and I'll be covering these in sections 
they're more relevant.

I introduced you to quite a few methods 
on the **java.util.Collections class**, 
and showed you examples, using a deck of cards. 
Now, it's your turn. 
Think for a moment about a card game that you'd enjoy building,
and one you know some of the rules for.

1. **Create a deck of cards** either a standard deck, 
or a deck that's specialized the card game you want to create. 
Feel free to use my Card record from the last several sections 
as a place to start, or if you want to start from scratch 
with your own Card class, by all means, try that out.
2. **Shuffle your deck**. 
Maybe you want to include cutting the deck, after shuffling.
3. **Deal your players' hands**.
Pick the number of players playing, and figure out 
how you'll deal the cards, one at a time to each hand, 
or some other way. 
For example, in pinochle, 
it's common to deal the cards out three or four at
a time to each player, until the deck is exhausted.
4. **Evaluate your players' hands** for card combinations 
that are important to the game.
5. Use a combination of **java.util.Collections** and **List** methods 
to achieve your results.

## [d. Equal and HashCode Methods]()
<div align="justify">

I'll discuss two classes, HashSet and HashMap, 
which are based on the hash codes of objects. 
This can be a confusing topic for new programmers, 
so I want to spend some extra time explaining it. 

I showed you an image of an abstract set, 
which showed chaotically placed elements. 
Since sets are unique because they don't support duplicates, 
adding an element always incurs the cost of first 
checking for a match. 
If your set is large or huge, this becomes a costly operation, 
O(n), or linear time, 
if you remember the Big-O notations I covered previously.
A mechanism to reduce this cost is introduced by something called hashing. 
If we created two buckets of elements, 
and the element could consistently identify,
which bucket it was stored in, then half could reduce the lookup. 
If we created four buckets, we could reduce the cost by a quarter. 
A hashed collection will optimally create a limited set of buckets, 
to provide an even distribution of the objects 
across the buckets in a full set. 
A hash code can be any valid integer, 
so it could be one of 4.2 billion valid numbers. 
If your collection only contains 100 thousand elements, 
you don't want to back it with a storage mechanism of 
four billion possible placeholders.
And you don't want to have to iterate through 100 thousand 
elements one at a time to find a match or a duplicate.
A hashing mechanism will take an integer hash code, 
and a capacity declaration which specifies 
the number of buckets to distribute the objects over. 
It then translates the range of hash codes 
into a range of bucket identifiers. 
Hashed implementations use a combination of the hash code and other means, 
to provide the most efficient bucketing system,
to achieve this desired uniform distribution of the objects.
</div>

### Hashing Starts With Understanding Equality
<div align="justify">

To understand hashing in Java, I think it helps 
to first understand the equality of objects. 
I've touched on this in previous lectures, 
but now I want to be sure you thoroughly understand 
this subject because it matters when dealing with any hashed collections.
There are two methods on **java.util.Object** that all objects inherit.

| Testing for equality              | The hashcode Method   |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| public boolean equals(Object obj) | public int hashCode() |

These are _equals_ and _hashCode_, 
and I show the method signatures from Object here. 
The implementation of equals on Object is shown here. 
It simply returns _this == obj_.

```java  
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    return (this == obj);
}
```
            
Do you remember what _==_ means for Objects? 
It means two variables have the _same reference to a single object in memory_. 
Because both references are pointing to the same object, 
then this is a good equality test. 
Objects can be considered equal in other instances as well, 
if their attribute values are equal, for example. 
The String class overrides this method, 
so that it compares all the characters in each String, 
to confirm that two Strings are equal. 
Let's review this in some code, 
as the jumping off point for understanding the hash code.

```java  
String aText = "Hello";
String bText = "Hello";
String cText = String.join("l","He","lo");
String dText = "He".concat("llo");
String eText = "hello";
```

I'll set up a series of String local variables. 
I'll set _a-text_ and _b-text_ to the same string literal, 
so _Hello_ in double quotes. 
I have _c-text_, and that's assigned the result of calling 
_String.join_ with _l_, as the first argument,
and _He_, and _lo_, as the next two arguments. 
_d-text_ is the result of concatenating _llo_, 
to the string literal _He_.
Finally, _e-text_ is set to the string literal, 
_hello_, but all lowercase this time. 
Now, I'll create a list out of these strings, 
so I can process them more easily.

```java  
List<String> hellos = Arrays.asList(aText, bText, cText, dText, eText);
hellos.forEach(s -> System.out.println(s + ": " + s.hashCode()));
```

I'll call asList on the Arrays class, 
passing it my list of Strings.
Remember this takes a variable arguments list,
so I can just list all my strings there. 
Next, I'll print each of these Strings out, 
along with their hashCodes.
Running this code:

```java  
Hello: 69609650
Hello: 69609650
Hello: 69609650
Hello: 69609650
hello: 99162322
```

I've got five strings printed, 4 have the value _Hello_, 
with a capital _H_, and one is _hello_ with a lower case _h_.
Notice that all four of the Strings with a capital _h_, 
return the exact same hash code, 
but the last one is different.
Java doesn't care if these are different objects in memory 
when it tests the equality of Strings, 
using the equals method. 
It just cares that the characters match, in one instance, 
compared to another instance.

```java  
Set<String> mySet = new HashSet<>(hellos);
System.out.println("mySet = " + mySet);
System.out.println("# of elements = " + mySet.size());
```

Now, let's create a **Set** of strings. 
I do that by declaring **Set** as the type, 
with String as the type argument. 
I'll call it my _set_ and assign it a new **HashSet**, 
and I'll pass my _hellos_ list to the hash set constructor. 
A hash set is a class that implements the **Set** interface 
and tracks duplicates by their hash code. 
Most collections allow the creation of another collection type, 
by passing a different collection to the constructor, 
as I'm doing here, passing a list to a set 
but a Set's constructor allows any instance 
that implements Collection to be passed to it. 
Ok, now, I'll print out my set, and like a list, 
I can pass that to a **System.out.println** statement. 
I'll also print out the size of my set. 
Running this code:

```java  
mySet = [Hello, hello]
# of elements = 2
```

I get two elements in my set, _Hello_ with a capital _h_, 
and _hello_ with a lower case _h_. 
You can see the number of elements is 2, even though the list 
I passed to the constructor had five references. 
Let's loop through the elements and see 
which String references are really in this set.

```java  
for (String setValue : mySet) {
    System.out.print(setValue + ": ");
    for (int i = 0; i < hellos.size(); i++) {
        if (setValue == hellos.get(i)) {
            System.out.print(i + ", ");
        }
    }
    System.out.println(" ");
}
```

I'll loop through the elements in the set, 
using an enhanced for loop, printing the set value. 
I'll loop through the string in the _hellos_ list, 
using a traditional for loop. 
I'm going to compare the String in the set with the String in the list, 
and I want to use equals sign here, 
because I'm really interested in whether 
these instances are the same object in memory. 
If they're the same reference, I'll print out the index of the element in the list. 
I'll print a new line after a set element. 
And running that code:

```java  
---(same)
Hello: 0, 1,
hello: 4,
```

I get three matches. 
The first set element, _Hello_, with an uppercase _H_,
is the same reference as the first two list elements, 
at index 0 and 1. 
The "_hello_" element with lowercase is the last element 
in the Strings list. 
The hash set will only add new references to its collection 
if it doesn't find a match in its collection, 
first using the _hashCode_ and then the object's equals method. 
It uses hashCode to create a bucket identifier 
to store the new reference. 
I'll talk about the underlying mechanism of the hash set a bit later.

Our code sets up five String reference variables, 
but two of these referenced the same string object in memory,
as shown here with _aText_ and _bText_ pointing to the same string instance.

![image09](https://github.com/korhanertancakmak/JAVA/blob/master/src/Udemy/JavaProgrammingTimBuchalka/NewVersion/Section_11_Collections/images/image09.png?raw=true)

When we passed our list of five strings to the **HashSet**, 
it added only unique instances to its collection.
It locates elements to match by first deriving which bucket to look through, 
based on the hash code.
It then compares those elements to the next element to be added, 
with other elements in that bucket, using the _equals_ method. 
Again, we'll talk about how Java implements the **HashSet** in a bit. 
For now, I want you to understand how equality, 
and the _hashCode_ go hand in hand, when using hashed collections. 
Let's get back to the code and explore this a bit more.

```java  
public class PlayingCard {
    private String suit;
    private String face;
    private int internalHash;

    public PlayingCard(String suit, String face) {
        this.suit = suit;
        this.face = face;
        this.internalHash = 1;
    }
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return face + " of " + suit;
    }
}
```

This time I'll create my own class, again a playing card, 
called **PlayingCard** in the same package. 
I'll add three fields, suit and face as strings, 
and an integer I'll call internalHash.
I'll generate a constructor with only two arguments.
For the moment, I'll add a statement 
to set the internalHash field to one.
I'll explain this field in a little bit. 
I'll quickly add a _toString_ method, 
creating the default override. 
I'll return the face and the suit, in place of super _toString_. 
Ok, so that's the playing card. 
I'll go back to the main method on the main class, 
and now set up a couple of cards:

```java  
PlayingCard aceHearts = new PlayingCard("Hearts", "Ace");
PlayingCard kingClubs = new PlayingCard("Clubs", "King");
PlayingCard queenSpades = new PlayingCard("Spades", "Queen");
List<PlayingCard> cards = Arrays.asList(aceHearts, kingClubs, queenSpades);
cards.forEach(s -> System.out.println(s + ": " + s.hashCode()));
```

An ace of hearts, a king of clubs, and a queen of spades. 
I'll again create a list of these, passing the list of cards to the asList method. 
I'll print the hashCode for each. 
Running that code:

```java  
---(same)
Ace of Hearts: 2065951873
King of Clubs: 793589513
Queen of Spades: 1313922862
```
                
You can see I get unique hash codes for each. 
Let's create a set of cards and add the cards one at a time.

```java  
Set<PlayingCard> deck = new HashSet<>();
for (PlayingCard c : cards) {
    if (!deck.add(c)) {
        System.out.println("Found a duplicate for " + c);
    }
}
System.out.println(deck);
```

I'll call the Set of cards deck, and make it a **HashSet**. 
Loop through the _cards_ list.
Add these cards one at a time.
The _add_ method on any collection returns true 
if the element is successfully added, and false if not. 
Because sets don't allow duplicates, 
it becomes more important to check if the element you expect 
to be added, really was added.
In _if (!deck.add(c))_, I check if I get false back, and if so, 
I'll print that a duplicate was found. 
I'm also printing the entire set after this loop to see 
what's been added to the set. 
Running this code:

```java  
---(same)
[Ace of Hearts, King of Clubs, Queen of Spades]
```

We see that all three cards were added to the set. 
The elements are not guaranteed to be in any order, 
so you may not see the elements printed in the same order as mine, 
or in the order you added the elements. 
Ok, next I want to go back to the PlayingCard class, 
and override both the _hashCode_ and the _equals_ method.

```java  
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    //return super.equals(o); 

    System.out.println("--> Checking Playing Card equality");
    return true;
}
```

Now, instead of returning _super.equals_ in the _equals_ method, 
which we know just calls the equals method on Object,
I'll just return true, so that all my objects will be equal no matter what.
But first, I want to print out something from this method, 
like _checking playing card equality_, 
so I can see when this method is called. 
Ok, when we run the code,
This gives me the same result as before, 
but it doesn't appear the equals method on Playing card was ever executed, 
because my statement I just added was never printed. 
I want to change the hashCode method here next:

```java  
@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return super.hashCode();
}
```

This time, I'm just going to return my internal hash field,
which is currently just set to 1. 
Now, I want to run it again:

```java  
---(same)
Ace of Hearts: 1
King of Clubs: 1
Queen of Spades: 1
--> Checking Playing Card equality
Found a duplicate for King of Clubs
--> Checking Playing Card equality
Found a duplicate for Queen of Spades
[Ace of Hearts]
```
                
You can see the hashCode is 1, for all three cards. 
But now you can see, the code is calling the equals method 
during the second and third iteration of the loop, 
and it indicates it's finding duplicates in each case. 
The final result is that it considered every other playing card a duplicate, 
and so only one card is in the set, 
the first in our list, the ace of hearts. 
The only time the equals method is called 
when adding elements to the hash set is 
when the hash code algorithm returns the same bucket identifier, 
which is true here, for our hash code = 1.

```java  
public class PlayingCard {
    private String suit;
    private String face;
    private int internalHash;

    public PlayingCard(String suit, String face) {
        this.suit = suit;
        this.face = face;
        //this.internalHash = 1;
        this.internalHash = (suit.equals("Hearts")) ? 11 : 12;
    }
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return face + " of " + suit;
    }
}
```

Let's go up, and change the internal hash to return an 11 
if the suit is hearts, and 12 if it doesn't. 
Let's run this:

```java  
---(same)
Ace of Hearts: 11
King of Clubs: 12
Queen of Spades: 12
--> Checking Playing Card equality
Found a duplicate for Queen of Spades
[Ace of Hearts, King of Clubs]
```
                
You can see the hash code for the ace of hearts is 11, 
but in other cases it's 12.
Where there is a duplicate hash code, the equals method is called, 
which always returns true, so the third element, 
the Queen of Spades, doesn't get added.
Let's comment these two overridden methods, _hashCode_ and _equals_, 
and instead use IntelliJ's code generation tools to regenerate them. 
The first time you go into this tool, the Template won't show IntelliJ default,
so select that like so.

Let's comment these two overridden methods, 
_hashCode_ and _equals_, and instead use IntelliJ's code 
generation tools to regenerate them. 
The first time you go into this tool, the Template won't show IntelliJ default, 
so select that like so.
We want to use getters, so tick that box. 
Leave the other checkbox unchecked. 
Click next. 
For fields to be included in equals, ensure only suit 
and face are selected and click next.

For fields to be included in hashcode,
select box fields, and Next again.
You actually now want to check both boxes. 
But I want to show you the code 
generated if this is not checked. 
So I'll ensure both are deselected here and 
click Create. 
Looking at the hash code, we have these extra tests for null. 
Which we really don't need.
So what I am going to do is undo this with _ctrl+Z_, 
and go through the creating of the methods again. 
Note that this time IntelliJ remembers my Template selection
and also that I checked the use getters during code generation. 
I'll click Next. 
I'll deselect internal Hash like last time and click next. 
For _hashcode_ I'll leave both fields selected and click Next. 
This time for non-null fields, I'll check both, 
as we know these won't be null and click Create again. 
This is as good as any implementation for these methods.

```java  
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) return true;
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;

    PlayingCard that = (PlayingCard) o;

    if (!suit.equals(that.suit)) return false;
    return face.equals(that.face);
}
```

Notice that the equals method first checks for equal references,
because two references pointing to the same object
is the surest test of equality. 
Then it compares the result of the getClass methods on both objects, 
and if they're equal, it will cast the object passed to a Playing Card.
It then checks if the suits are equal. 
If they are, it will check if the faces are equal.

```java  
@Override
public int hashCode() {
    int result = suit.hashCode();
    result = 31 * result + face.hashCode();
    return result;
}
```

You can see the hashCode implementation that was generated. 
It starts with the hashCode for the string for the suit. 
It then uses that, multiplying it by 31, a small prime number, 
and adding the hash code for the string, the face string's hash code. 
Running this code:

```java  
---(same)
Ace of Hearts: -1834509066
King of Clubs: 2023815418
Queen of Spades: -269088580
[Ace of Hearts, King of Clubs, Queen of Spades]
```
                
You see our set has all three cards in it, 
and the hash codes for each card are unique.
</div>

### Creating HashCode Method
<div align="justify">

You don't have to use the generated algorithm as I did here. 
You could create your own, but your code should stick to the following rules.

1. It should be rapid to compute.
2. It should produce a consistent result each time it's called.
For example, you wouldn't want to use a random number generator, 
or a date-time-based algorithm that would return a different 
value each time the method is called.
3. Objects that are considered equal should produce the same hashCode.
4. Values used in the calculation should not be mutable.

It is common practice to include a small prime number 
as a multiplicative factor (although some non-prime numbers 
also provide good distributions). 
This helps ensure a more even distribution 
for the bucket identifier algorithm, 
especially if your data might exhibit clustering in some way. 
IntelliJ and other code generation tools use 31, 
but other good options could be 29, 33 (not prime but shown to have good results), 
37, 43 and so on. 
You want to avoid the single digit primes, 
because more numbers will be divisible by those, 
and may not produce the even distribution 
that will lend itself to improved performance. 
For those who like to understand how things really work, 
let me encourage you to do some research on this topic. 
For the rest of you, remember that 
if you are using your own classes in hashed collections, 
you'll want to override both the equals and the hashCode methods. 
I'll be covering this quite a bit over the next couple of lectures, 
so you'll have more time to get exposed to these concepts. 
Java supports four hashed collections implementation, 
which we'll be looking at coming up. 
These are the HashSet, LinkedHashSet, the HashMap, and LinkedHashMap. 
In addition, there's one legacy implementation, 
the HashTable, which I won't be covering, 
since there are more efficient implementations that replace this legacy class.
</div>

## [e. Set & Map Interfaces]()
<div align="justify">

Like the code setup lecture of Collections CardGame I presented earlier, 
this is another lecture that will set up code 
for upcoming lectures on sets. 

In this example, _I'll be using HashSets as fields_, 
and I'll use the **Scanner** class, 
which I've used many times before, 
always passing _System.in_ to the constructor. 
In this code, _I'll be using **Scanner** with just 
a String passed to the constructor_". 
It works similarly.
If you want to see this in action, be sure to follow along. 
Eventually I'll cover reading input from files, 
although this code won't be doing that. 
Using scanner this way, gives you a taste for a way to do this, 
without the file complexities which I'll cover later. 

![image10](https://github.com/korhanertancakmak/JAVA/blob/master/src/Udemy/JavaProgrammingTimBuchalka/NewVersion/Section_11_Collections/images/image10.png?raw=true)

In this setup code, you want to create a **Contact** class
that has the fields, a String name, a HashSet of String emails and phones. 
This class should have multiple constructors. 
The first just takes a name. 
The second should have name, and a single email of type String. 
Next, another with two arguments, name, 
but this time a long, which represents a 10-digit phone number. 
Lastly, the constructor that should do most of the work, 
the last in your chain, in other words, should take name, 
a single email, and a single phone.

This last constructor should do the following:
* Add the email argument to the emails set, if email is not null.
* Transform the phone argument, a long, (if it's not zero), 
to a string in the format (123) 456â€“7890, for example.
* Add the transformed phone to the phone set.

This class should also include three public instance methods. 
A getter for name, an override for the toString method will print the name, 
set of emails, and set of phones in a simple form. 
Finally, include a method called _mergeContactData_, 
that takes a contact, and returns a new **Contact** instance, 
which merges the current instance with the **Contact** passed. 
I've only just started the conversation about **Sets** and **HashSets**, 
but you should be able to set up emails and phones as shown 
for this setup.

The **ContactData** class is going to emulate getting data 
from an external source, but instead of an external source, 
I just want you to set this data up with two different text blocks, 
in the format shown below. 
This data purposely has duplicates.

| Phone Data                | Email Data                           |

**Create a method named _getData_** that **takes a String type** 
(either **phone** or **email**), and returns a List of **Contact**.
Now, I'm going to use **Scanner** to parse the data in these text blocks. 
My reason for using **Scanner**, is twofold.

First, I want to demonstrate this variation, 
and second, I want you to imagine this data coming 
from an input file or a database. 
IO and database access are for a later section, 
but this code simulates getting data from an external source. 
However, you do it, you want to parse this data, 
create a contact for each row, and return the list. 
You want to return the lists separately, meaning return a list of phones, 
or a list of emails, based on the type passed to this method. 

Now, I'll create the Contact class:

```java  
public class Contact {

    private String name;
    private Set<String> emails = new HashSet<>();
    private Set<String> phones = new HashSet<>();
}
```

And I'll put it in the same package. 
I want three fields in this class, 
which I described in the challenge info. 
Name as string, emails, and phones both declared as sets, 
and assigned new HashSet instances. 
I'm going to make emails and phones both HashSets, 
because I don't want duplicates in my contact data.

```java  
public Contact(String name) {
    this(name, null);
}

public Contact(String name, String email) {
    this(name, email, 0);
}

public Contact(String name, long phone) {
    this(name, null, phone);
}
```

Next, I want a series of constructors. 
I'm going to set most of these up manually, 
because my constructor arguments aren't going 
to match up with my fields. 
I'll use IntelliJ's tools to generate for the first one, 
which has an argument for just name. 
But I don't want to set the name field here.
Instead, I want to chain another constructor 
that I haven't yet created, one with two arguments,
and I'll pass name, and null for email. 
I'll add another constructor, has two arguments,
the new argument is going to be String and email, 
and I'm going to chain this to another constructor call, 
to a three argument constructor, defaulting zero as the phone 
as the third argument. 
I'll add another constructor again, 
I'll add phone as a long in the parameters, 
and then I'll add it to the three constructor calls. 
For the last constructor, I'm just going to manually type this one out 
and talk through it. 
As I stated in my challenge info, this will have name 
and email, both strings, and a long for phone.

```java  
public Contact(String name, String email, long phone) {
    this.name = name;
    if (email != null) {
        emails.add(email);
    }
    if (phone > 0) {
        String p = String.valueOf(phone);
        p = "(%s) %s-%s".formatted(p.substring(0, 3), p.substring(3, 6),
                p.substring(6));
        phones.add(p);
    }
}
```

Ok, the _name_ is straightforward; 
I'm just assigning it to the method argument. 
Next, I want to add the _email_ passed to this constructor,
to the emails set on this class, 
only if email is not equal to null. 
Now, adding the phone is a bit more complicated,
first of all because it's a long, and it needs to be a String, 
formatted in a specific way. 
If the phone number isn't greater than 0, I won't do anything. 
If it is, I'll first create a String out of it, 
using the value of method, passing it a long, the phone. 
I'll now set up a formatted string, and pass the first three digits, 
then the next three, and the final four, 
which is how phone numbers are formatted in some US entries. 
Then, I'll simply add that local variable to the phone set. 
Ok, so that's all the constructors. 
Now I have three methods I need to code.

```java  
public String getName() {
    return name;
}

@Override
public String toString() {
    return "%s: %s %s".formatted(name, emails, phones);
}
```

First a getter for _name_, so I'll generate that. 
I also want a _toString_ method. 
I'll use the override feature in IntelliJ, to generate that. 
I want to replace that return line, 
which is _return super.toString()_ with my own formatted String. 
Like lists, I can pass sets right to _println_, 
or to the formatted method, as I show here.

```java  
public Contact mergeContactData(Contact contact) {

    Contact newContact = new Contact(name);
    newContact.emails = new HashSet<>(this.emails);
    newContact.phones = new HashSet<>(this.phones);
    newContact.emails.addAll(contact.emails);
    newContact.phones.addAll(contact.phones);
    return newContact;
}
```

Ok, I've got one last method. 
That's public returns a Contact, 
I'll name it _mergeContactData_, and it takes a Contact as an argument. 
I'll create a local variable, also a contact, 
and assign that a new Contact instance, 
passing the name on the current instance to that constructor. 
That gets returned from this method.
But I also want to include the emails 
and phones from both contacts, 
so I'll set the emails on the new contact 
to be a new hash set, passing it the current instance's emails. 
I'll do the same thing for the phones, 
passing it the phones which are on the current instance.
At this juncture, this code is really just cloning the data, 
by using all the data from the current instance, 
to create a new contact. 
To make it a merge, I want to add the emails and phones 
from the contact passed to this method. 
To do that, I can just call "_addAll_" on the new Contact's emails field, 
and pass it the emails on the Contact that is passed to this method. 
I'll do the same thing for the phones. 
Ok, so that completes the Contact class. 
Now I want to do the second part of the code setup, 
and that's to create a ContactData class:

```java  
public class ContactData {

    private static final String phoneData = """
            Charlie Brown, 3334445555
            Maid Marion, 1234567890

            Mickey Mouse, 1247489758

            Mickey Mouse, 9998887777
            """;

    private static final String emailData = """
            Mickey Mouse, mckmouse@gmail.com

            Linus Van Pelt, lvpelt2015@gmail.com
            Daffy Duck, daffy@google.com
            """;
    
    public static List<Contact> getData(String type) {

        List<Contact> dataList = new ArrayList<>();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(type.equals("phone") ? phoneData : emailData);
        while (scanner.hasNext()) {
            String[] data = scanner.nextLine().split(",");
            Arrays.asList(data).replaceAll(String::trim);
            if (type.equals("phone")) {
                dataList.add(new Contact(data[0], Long.parseLong(data[1])));
            } else if (type.equals("email")) {
                dataList.add(new Contact(data[0], data[1]));
            }
        }
        return dataList;
    }
}
```

That would simulate a data reader of some kind. 
In our case, this is just going to read data from static strings,
but you could imagine we could read this data from ta file, 
a database, or get it from some kind of service provider.
Again, in the same package, I'll create a new class named **ContactData**. 
I'll create two static text fields, using text blocks, 
one for phone data, and one for email data. 
Initially, both fields will be empty. 
I'm just going to paste this data in.

```java  
public static List<Contact> getData(String type) {
    List<Contact> dataList = new ArrayList<>();
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(type.equals("phone") ? phoneData : emailData);
    while (scanner.hasNext()) {
        String[] data = scanner.nextLine().split(",");
        Arrays.asList(data).replaceAll(String::trim);
        if (type.equals("phone")) {
            dataList.add(new Contact(data[0], Long.parseLong(data[1])));
        } else if (type.equals("email")) {
            dataList.add(new Contact(data[0], data[1]));
        }
    }
    return dataList;
}
```

Ok, so next, I want a method to read this data, 
emulating reading it from a file, 
or retrieving it from an external source. 
This is going to be a public static method called getData,
it'll take a String, which will identify 
if it's retrieving phone or email data, 
and it'll return a List of contacts. 
I'll set up a local variable, data list, 
and instantiate a new array list. 
I'll return this local variable from the method.
Now, I'll set up my scanner variable. 
If the type is phone, 
I'll pass in the phoneData text block to the constructor. 
If the type is email, I'll pass in the emailData text block. 
You've seen **Scanner** before with _System.in_, 
but it can also be used with any string, 
including a multi-string text block, 
which is what I'm doing here. 
There are other ways to split this data by new lines and so forth,
and I'll show you these examples in future code. 
I wanted to write the code this way, 
as a sort of mock file read if you will. 
Now I can use the Scanner functionality 
to treat the string like any input stream. 
I'll use a while loop to continue looping 
while hasNext on the scanner is true. 
I'll call the nextLine to get the next string 
and split that on a comma, 
passing it to a local variable, data, an array of strings. 
I'll pass the array to the asList method on Arrays, 
so that I can use the replaceAll method,
passing it the method reference for the trim method on String.
This is going to trim leading and trailing whitespace, 
from each of the strings in my text block. 
I could have also used strip Indent there, 
but I've formatted my text block itself without indents,
so I won't worry about it, for simplicity. 
Next, I want to create specific types of contacts, 
based on the type passed.
If the type is phone, I'll add a new Contact, 
using the constructor that takes name, 
which is the first comma delimited element, 
in both of my text block elements. 
I'll also pass it the phone number, 
which I first need to parse, using parseLong on the long wrapper. 
The phone number is the second comma delimited element, in my text block. 
If the type is email, 
I'll just pass the second comma delimited element as is, 
which is the email as a string. 
And that's it. 
That's the setup. 
I'll add a public static print method on the Main class.

```java  
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Contact> emails =  ContactData.getData("email");
        List<Contact> phones = ContactData.getData("phone");
        printData("Phone List", phones);
        printData("Email List", emails);
    }
    public static void printData(String header, Collection<Contact> contacts) {

        System.out.println("----------------------------------------------");
        System.out.println(header);
        System.out.println("----------------------------------------------");
        contacts.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

I'll call it _printData_, and it'll take a string, 
a header, as well as a Collection, with a type of Contact.
This prints the header between some separator lines,
and then uses forEach to print each contact. 
Next, I'll test this out.
In the main method, I'll create a List, called emails, 
and assign that the result of calling getData 
on my ContactData class with emails as the type. 
I'll repeat that for phone, invoking the same method, 
but passing phone as the type. 
I'll execute my new printData method to print first the emails, 
and then the phones. 
Running that:

```java

Daffy Duck: [daffy@google.com] []
```

I'm getting the list of phone contacts, and the list of email contacts, 
printed out neatly, You can see I have several _Mickey Mouses_ in both lists, 
and a couple of _Robin Hoods_ in the phone list. 
Ok, so that was the setup challenge. 
I'll be using this code to explore sets, 
and merging contacts using sets. 

A Set is not implicitly ordered. 
A Set contains no duplicates. 
A Set may contain a single null element. 
Sets can be useful because operations on them are rapid. 
In fact, the lack of duplicates is the most important differentiator, 
as there are ordered sets, such as the **LinkedHashSet**, and **TreeSet**.

The **set** interface defines the basic methods 
_add_, _remove_ and _clear_, to maintain the items in the set. 
We can also check if a specific item is in the set using the contains method. 
Interestingly enough, there's no way to retrieve an item from a set. 
You can check if something exists, using _contains_, 
and you can iterate over all the elements in the set,
but attempting to get the 10th element, for example, 
from a set isn't possible, with a single method.

The best-performing implementation of the **Set** interface 
is the **HashSet class**. 
This class uses hashing mechanisms to store the items. 
This means the hash code method is used 
to support even distributions of objects in the set. 
Oracle describes this class as offering constant time performance 
for the basic operations (add, remove, contains and size).
This assumes the hash function disperses the elements properly 
among the buckets.
Constant time has the Big O Notation O(1). 
Although I haven't covered the Map and HashMap types yet, 
the **HashSet** actually uses a **HashMap** in its own implementation,
as of JDK 8. 
Later, when I cover maps and hash maps, 
I'll swing back and explain how the **HashSet** uses a hash map under
its covers.

In the lecture called Set Up for **Sets** and **Maps**, 
I created code for a Contact class, 
as well as code that simulated getting phone lists and email lists, 
from an external source. 
I have two classes set up in this code:

1. The **Contact** class that consists of a name, a set of phones, 
which are strings, and a set of emails, also strings.
This class has only three methods on it. 
The first two are a getter for name, a
s well as an overridden _toString_ method.
There's also a merge **Contact** Data method
that has a contact as an argument, and creates a new contact. 
It populates the new contact, first with the data on the current instance, 
and then merges emails and phone numbers, from the contact passed to this method.

2. The **ContactData** has one method on it, _getData_, 
that takes a type, a String, and will return a list of Contact instances. 
The _type_ can be _phone_ or _email_. 
If I pass _phone_, I get a list of contacts each with a single phone number. 
If I pass _email_, I get a list of contacts with a single email. 
The data's stored as text blocks, simulating what each record might look like,
in a comma-delimited file. 
Data is read by a Scanner instance, constructed with one of these text blocks. 
Every time I call getData on this class, 
I'll get a new list with new instances of contacts.

```java  
List<Contact> emails =  ContactData.getData("email");
List<Contact> phones = ContactData.getData("phone");
printData("Phone List", phones);
printData("Email List", emails);
```

I get the two lists from the ContactData, 
and the contact info printed out. 
Ok, so now imagine I've got a list of names with phone numbers,
with my mobile phone contacts, 
and also a list of email contacts from an internet provider.
Now, I want to combine these contacts, 
merging any duplicates into a single contact, 
with multiple emails and phone numbers, on a single record. 
To do this, I'll create two Sets:

```java  
Set<Contact> emailContacts = new HashSet<>(emails);
Set<Contact> phoneContacts = new HashSet<>(phones);
printData("Phone Contacts", phoneContacts);
printData("Email Contacts", emailContacts);
```

Two **HashSets** to be specific, one for the phone data, 
and one for the email data. 
Like Lists, I start with the interface type as the variable type, 
so **Set** here, and a type argument of **Contact**, in both cases. 
The first variable, email contacts will be assigned a new **HashSet**, 
constructed by passing the email list to it. 
The phone contacts are the same, a new **Hashset** 
but constructed using the phone list. 
Most constructors of classes implementing the **Collection** interface,
support a constructor that accepts a **Collection**. 
You can see this lets me very quickly create anew hashSet from a list, 
with one line of code. 
I'll again use my printData method on this class, passing a header, 
and the phone or email contacts. 
The _printData_ method will take any **Collection** type, 
meaning any instance of a class that implements **Collection**. 
This lets me pass any list or a set to this method to get printed. 
Let me run this.

```java  
----------------------------------------------

Minnie Mouse: [minnie@verizon.net] []
```

Here, I hope you can see, 
there are still duplicates in both of these sets, 
but the order is different from the order that was in the list. 
Can you guess why there's duplicates in these sets, 
even though I just said earlier, 
that **HashSets** won't have duplicates? 
Well, duplicates are determined, for hashed collections, 
first by the hash code, and then the _equals_ method. 
In this instance, both the hash code method, 
and the _equals_ method, are using Object's implementation. 
This means each of these instances of contacts is considered unique, 
by that definition. 
In most cases, this is probably a good thing. 
But since these are personal contacts, 
I'm going to make a rule, that _contacts_ that have the same _name_ 
are really the same person, 
but with different data. 
To implement this rule, 
I want to go to the **Contact** class, 
and generate both an _equals_ method, and a _hashCode_ method.

```java  
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) return true;
    if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;

    Contact contact = (Contact) o;

    return getName().equals(contact.getName());
}
@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return 33 * getName().hashCode();
}
```

Instead of selecting the IntelliJ default, 
I want to select **java.util.Objects.equals** 
and hashCode (java 7 +). 
I'll accept the defaults for the first two screens, 
where all fields are selected. 
In the third dialogue, where it says select all non-null fields, 
I'm going to just select name here. 
Now I want to examine these generated methods, in light of 
what I've previously talked about. 
First, let's look at the equals method.
We've said before that if the references are equal,
they're the same instance, 
and we can return true in this case. 
Next, the code checks if the object passed is a null, 
or if the classes (or types) of the objects differ.
If either of these conditions is true, then these are definitely not equal. 
Since the class type was previously checked, 
and found to be the same type as the current instance,
we can safely cast the object _o_, to a contact. 
Ok, so notice that for name, which is the only field
I said was non-null, the code is directly calling the _equals_ method, 
against the _getName_ results on both objects. 
For the other two fields, the code is using another utility class, 
called Objects, a class in the java util package.
If I press control click on that class name, Objects, 
I can see the comments in the code, 
explaining that this is a utility class, 
introduced in JDK 7. 
This class provides static utility methods to handle nulls, 
to generate equals results, and hash codes.
Getting back to the code, you could guess that a contact is equal,
based on the name, and if the other attributes aren't null,
by matching on emails and phones.

```java  
@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return 33 * getName().hashCode();
}
```

Now, look at the hash code method. 
Here again, it's using the Objects class, 
calling a hash method on that. 
I'll press control click on the hash method next. 
You can see here, this method takes a variable arguments parameter, 
and this code simply passes those off to the hash Code method, 
on **java.util.Arrays**. 
And continuing, I'll press control click on _hashCode_ there. 
From this, you see that Java, like IntelliJ, 
creates a hash code using 31, as a multiplier for each values' hash code. 
Ok, so there's no right way to generate these methods; 
a lot will depend on your own organizations' standards. 
I'll run my code again, with these methods in place now.

```java  
----------------------------------------------
Phone Contacts
----------------------------------------------
Mickey Mouse: [] [(124) 748-9758]
Charlie Brown: [] [(333) 444-5555]
Maid Marion: [] [(123) 456-7890]
Robin Hood: [] [(789) 902-8222]
Minnie Mouse: [] [(456) 780-5666]
Robin Hood: [] [(564) 789-3000]
Mickey Mouse: [] [(999) 888-7777]
Lucy Van Pelt: [] [(564) 208-6852]
----------------------------------------------
Email Contacts
----------------------------------------------
Mickey Mouse: [mckmouse@gmail.com] []
Mickey Mouse: [micky1@aws.com] []
Minnie Mouse: [minnie@verizon.net] []
Robin Hood: [rhood@gmail.com] []
Linus Van Pelt: [lvpelt2015@gmail.com] []
Daffy Duck: [daffy@google.com] []
```

My set still contains duplicate names, 
but Mickey Mouse only has one entry now, 
for _(999) 888â€“7777_ in its phone number. 
This means my contacts are distinct by the name, 
all the emails, and all the phone numbers.

Going back to the Contact class,
I'll again delete both the _equals_ and _hashCode_ method. 
I'll regenerate these,
using Intelli-J's default template, 
but in every instance, on each dialogue window, 
I want to just check the name.
Make sure to select name on the last dialogue,
where it's not selected as a default.
Now, here, _hashCode_ doesn't use a multiplier,
but simply returns the name's hash code.
This means a **Contact** instance, and a String, 
which has the value Mickey Mouse, will result in the same hash code. 
This is ok, but it's usually a good idea to have objects 
which are a different class type, return different hash codes, 
so I'm going to add my own multiplier here.
I'll make it 33, a composite number, but some research indicates, 
this multiplier can produce consistent results similar to 31.
As with almost everything in software engineering, 
there's debate over what the best multiplier might be. 
I don't want you to think that 33 is better than 31, 
it's just a different choice. 
I know this will drive a couple of my students to go 
and research that debate, and that's a good thing. 
For my own small sets in this code, 
it isn't really going to matter. 
Now, if I run the code again:

```java  
----------------------------------------------
Phone Contacts
----------------------------------------------
Lucy Van Pelt: [] [(564) 208-6852]
Charlie Brown: [] [(333) 444-5555]
Maid Marion: [] [(123) 456-7890]
Robin Hood: [] [(564) 789-3000]
Mickey Mouse: [] [(999) 888-7777]
Minnie Mouse: [] [(456) 780-5666]
----------------------------------------------
Email Contacts
----------------------------------------------
Linus Van Pelt: [lvpelt2015@gmail.com] []
Robin Hood: [rhood@gmail.com] []
Mickey Mouse: [mckmouse@gmail.com] []
Daffy Duck: [daffy@google.com] []
Minnie Mouse: [minnie@verizon.net] []
```
                    
I get only distinct records by name in each set. 
My sets no longer have multiple records for a single contact name.
Using this method to create my sets, however, 
means I've lost a couple of phone numbers and emails in the process.
To resolve that, I'm going to add two methods to the Contact class.

```java  
public void addEmail(String companyName) {

    String[] names = name.split(" ");
    String email = "%c%s@%s.com".formatted(name.charAt(0), names[names.length - 1],
            companyName.replaceAll(" ", "").toLowerCase());
    emails.add(email);
}
```

The first method will generate and _add_ a company email 
to the current instance's email set. 
This will be public, void, called addEmail, 
and take a string, company name. 
This code splits the contact name into an array of strings,
splitting on a space. 
The email is made up of the first character of the name, 
then the last string in the array,
which I'm going to assume is the last name. 
That's followed by the company name, 
removing any spaces in it, and finally appending _.com_ to that. 
Then I execute just the add method on the emails set, 
passing this new String.
To test this out, I'll add a call to this method in the main method.

```java  
int index = emails.indexOf(new Contact("Robin Hood"));
Contact robinHood = emails.get(index);
robinHood.addEmail("Sherwood Forest");
System.out.println(robinHood);
```

But I want to first get _Robin Hood_ from the list of email contacts. 
I can do this by first creating a new Contact,
using just the name _Robin Hood_ now. 
I can pass this new contact, 
to the index-of method on the email list, 
which returns the integer index, where that element is located the list. 
Then I can use the get method on the list 
to return the original email contact, which is what I want. 
Now that I've got the original Robin Hood contact, 
I'll add the company email to this record, 
calling the addEmail method with the company name, 
Sherwood Forest. 
I'll add that statement before the _system.out.println_ statement. 
If I run that:

You can see my method works, and now I have two emails for Robin Hood, 
one is _rhood@sherwoodforest.com_. 
So what happens if I call that method again? 
Actually, before I do that, 
I want to change the _addEmail_ method on **contact**.

```java  
public void addEmail(String companyName) {

    String[] names = name.split(" ");
    String email = "%c%s@%s.com".formatted(name.charAt(0), names[names.length - 1],
            companyName.replaceAll(" ", "").toLowerCase());
    //emails.add(email);
    if (!emails.add(email)) {
        System.out.println(name + " already has email " + email);
    } else {
        System.out.println(name + " now has email " + email);
    }
}
```

The _add_ method on any collection instance returns a boolean 
if the element is added successfully.
I want to test that result here.
I'll remove the _emails.add_ statement, 
and replace it with an if statement, 
that executes the add method on this set, 
and tests the value returned, the negated value. 
If add returns false, 
I print that emails already have that value in its set, otherwise,
I'll print that it was added. 
Getting back to the main method,

```java  
int index = emails.indexOf(new Contact("Robin Hood"));
Contact robinHood = emails.get(index);
robinHood.addEmail("Sherwood Forest");
robinHood.addEmail("Sherwood Forest");
//System.out.println(robinHood);
```

I'll copy that first addEmail statement, 
and paste a copy right below it. 
Running this,

```java  
Robin Hood now has email RHood@sherwoodforest.com
Robin Hood already has email RHood@sherwoodforest.com
```

You can see that the first time, _RHood@sherwoodforest.com_ was added, 
but in the second instance, 
the _add_ wasn't successful because that email is already there. 
A better approach would have been to use the _contains_ method, 
before I did all the work of generating the email string. 
I'll do this in the next method I want to add to **Contact** Class:

```java  
public void replaceEmailIfExists(String oldEmail, String newEmail) {

    if (emails.contains(oldEmail)) {
        emails.remove(oldEmail);
        emails.add(newEmail);
    }
}
```

I'm going to call, _replaceEmailIfExists_, 
a public method with a _void_ return type. 
This method takes two Strings,
an old email, and a new email, both strings. 
It checks the set to see if the old email is in the set, 
using the contains method. 
If the old email is in the set, then it removes that old email, 
and adds the new email. 
In other words, the new email only gets added 
if the old email is found in the set first, 
so it'd really a replacement. 
Let's say I made a mistake, and now need to fix robin hood's email, 
changing it from _sherwoodforest.com_, 
to _sherwoodforest.org_. 
Going to the main method,
I'll add this statement 
after the second _addEmail_ call. 

```java  
robinHood.replaceEmailIfExists("RHood@sherwoodforest.com", "RHood@sherwoodforest.org");
System.out.println(robinHood);
```

Running that code,

```java  
Robin Hood: [RHood@sherwoodforest.org, rhood@gmail.com] []
```
                    
You can see that I successfully replaced the company email, 
with the dot org version, for Robin hood. 
Unlike lists, the hash set implementation doesn't include a replacement
or _replaceAll_ method. 
Those are the basic functions on **set**, _add_, _remove_, and _contains_. 
Now, there's no get method on a set. 
If you want to get an element from the set, 
you'll have to iterate through every element, 
and look for a match manually. 
And remember your **HashSet**'s not going to be ordered or sorted. 
Sets are valuable for groups of elements, 
when you'll be adding elements, removing duplicates, 
checking if an element is in the list, 
or other set operations I'll be covering shortly. 
This isn't the collection you'd use, 
if you mostly want to get elements from your collection, 
and manipulating values. 

Now, I'll talk about set operations 
which are ways to evaluate relationships of elements in different sets.
