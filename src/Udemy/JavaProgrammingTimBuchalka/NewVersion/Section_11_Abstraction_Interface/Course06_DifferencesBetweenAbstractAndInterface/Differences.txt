                                                Abstract Class

        In this course, I want to discuss the main differences between an abstract class and an interface, and when to
    use either of them.

  - Abstract classes are very similar to interfaces. You can't instantiate either of them. Both types may contain a mix
    of methods declared with, or without a method block. Remember, when a method has a method block {}, it's a concrete
    method, and we can say it's implemented, or provides an implementation for that method.
  - With abstract classes, you can declare fields that aren't static and final, instance fields in other words.
  - Also with abstract classes, you can use any of the four access modifiers for its concrete methods. So public, private,
    protected, or the default package.
  - You can also use all but the private access modifier, for its abstract methods.
  - An abstract class can extend only one parent class, but it can implement multiple interfaces.
  - When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all the abstract methods in
    its parent class.
  - However, if it doesn't, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.

        You'll want to use an abstract class, when:
  - You want to share code, among several closely related classes (Animal for example, with fields, name, age...).
  - You expect classes that extend your abstract class, to have many common methods or fields, or require access modifiers
    other than public.
  - You want to declare non-static or non-final fields (for example, name, age), so this enables you to define methods,
    that can access and modify the state of an object (getName, setName).
  - You have a requirement for your base class, to provide a default implementation of certain methods, but other methods
    should be open to being overridden by child classes.

    Summary: An abstract class provides a common definition, as a base class, that multiple, derived classes can share.

        Alright, now in comparison, looking at interface.

                                                Interface

  - An interface is just the declaration of methods, which you want some classes to have, it's not the implementation.
  - In an interface, we define what kind of operation an object can perform. These operations are defined by the classes
    that implement the interface.
  - Interfaces form a contract between the class, and the outside world, and this contract is enforced at build time, by
    the Java compiler.
  - You can't instantiate interfaces, but they may contain a mix of methods declared with, or without an implementation.
  - All methods on interfaces, declared without a method body, are automatically public and abstract.
  - An interface can extend another interface.
  - Interfaces are more flexible, and can deal with a lot more stress on the design of your program, because they aren't
    part of the class hierarchy.
  - A best practice way of coding, is commonly called Coding to an Interface.
  - By introducing interfaces into your program, you're really introducing points of variation, at which you can plug in
    different implementations for that interface.

    Summary: The interface decouples the "what", from the "how", and is used to make different types, behave in similar
    ways.
    Notes : Since Java 8, interfaces can now contain default methods, so in other words methods with implementation. The
    keyword default is used mostly for backwards compatibility. Public static methods were also introduced in Java 8.
    Notes : Since Java 9, an interface can also contain private methods, commonly used when default methods share common
    code.

        Alright, so when do you want to use an interface? Well, when:
  - You expect that unrelated classes will implement your interface. For example, two of Java's own interfaces, Comparable
    and Cloneable, can be implemented by many unrelated classes.
  - You want to specify the behavior of a particular data type, but you're not concerned about who implements its behavior.
  - You want to separate different behavior.

        I've briefly discussed some interfaces, like List and Queue, and their implementations, "ArrayList" and "LinkedList".
    These are part of what Java calls its Collections Framework. Interfaces are also the basis for many of the features
    that are coming up, for example "lambda expressions", which were introduced in JDK8. Another example is "Java's database
    connectivity support, or JDBC", built almost entirely with interfaces. The concrete implementation of methods, is different
    for each database vendor, and comes in the form of JDBC drivers. This enables you to write all database code, without
    being concerned about the details of the database, you're connected to.

        I've said that interfaces and abstract classes are both abstracted types, and abstracted types are used as reference
    types in code. The table below is a summary of the similarities and differences.

                                                              |  Abstract Class          |    Interface                             |

    Alright, so this is the differences between abstract classes and interfaces.
