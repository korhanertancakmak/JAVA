In this video, we're going to go ahead and install&nbsp;&nbsp;
the MySQL database server on a Windows machine.
If you're not running Windows, move on to&nbsp;&nbsp;



the next video – or the one after that –&nbsp;
where I show you how to do the same thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but on a Mac or a Linux computer.
But if you're using Windows,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you're in the right place, so let's continue.
The first thing we want to do, is go to the&nbsp;&nbsp;
website dev.MySQL.com. You may get a pop-up about&nbsp;
accepting cookies, so do whatever you normally&nbsp;&nbsp;
do when you get that pop-up. The download will&nbsp;
work fine if you decide to decline all cookies.&nbsp;
Ok, once we get here, I'm going&nbsp;
to click the downloads link.&nbsp;
I'll scroll down to towards the bottom and click&nbsp;
MySQL Community GPL Downlaods and click that.&nbsp;
We want the MySQL Installer for&nbsp;
Windows link, so click that.&nbsp;
On the next screen, Microsoft&nbsp;
Windows should already be selected.&nbsp;
Below that, we have two choices. Both&nbsp;
choices will install the same version,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and if you have a connection to the internet, then&nbsp;
it's not really important which one you choose.&nbsp;
The first one, the mysql-installer-web-community&nbsp;
one, will start the installation and then download&nbsp;&nbsp;
most of the files it needs, while it's installing.
You'd use that if you want to install MySQL on&nbsp;&nbsp;
the computer that you're using to download&nbsp;
– which is what we're doing at the moment.&nbsp;
But you might want to install the program&nbsp;
on several computers, or on a computer that&nbsp;&nbsp;
doesn't have internet access. In that&nbsp;
case, you can choose the second option,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and download the entire installer. As you&nbsp;
can see, that's a larger initial download.&nbsp;
Before we decide which one to use, notice&nbsp;
that there's an Information tab on that&nbsp;&nbsp;
screen – the blue "Information" icon.&nbsp;
Click that, to get a bit more information&nbsp;&nbsp;
about the installer choices we have.
There's a brief description of what the&nbsp;&nbsp;
installer includes: the latest version of the&nbsp;
MySQL Server itself, MySQL Workbench – which&nbsp;&nbsp;
we'll use to interact with the Server – and&nbsp;
some sample databases and documentation.&nbsp;
Below that, there's a note about Choosing&nbsp;
the right file. That pretty much echoes&nbsp;&nbsp;
what I've just said about the two options.
The note is interesting: "MySQL Installer is&nbsp;&nbsp;
32 bit, but will install both&nbsp;
32 bit and 64 bit binaries".&nbsp;
In a minute, I'm going to show you how to select&nbsp;
that, when we go through the installation process.&nbsp;
So you'll need to know whether&nbsp;
your Windows computer is&nbsp;&nbsp;
running a 32 or 64-bit version of Windows.



And you can generally find that in "About",&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the control panel for Windows&nbsp;
10 or earlier. If on Windows 11,&nbsp;&nbsp;
which I am go into Settings. Type "about" in&nbsp;
the search box, then click "About your PC".&nbsp;
And depending on your version of Windows, it'll&nbsp;
tell you System type 64-bit operating system.&nbsp;
We're not so much concerned about the&nbsp;
processor, because it is possible to have&nbsp;&nbsp;
a 32-bit version of windows running on a 64-bit&nbsp;



processor. We're interested in this bit here,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the 64-bit operating system.
You'll need to know whether you're&nbsp;&nbsp;
running the 32 or 64-bit version.



We've just seen how to check that&nbsp;&nbsp;
information on Windows 10 and 11.
If you're running an older version&nbsp;&nbsp;



of windows, you can generally find that&nbsp;
in the system part of control panel.&nbsp;
There'll be a screen similar to this, where you&nbsp;
can find out which version of Windows you're&nbsp;&nbsp;
running, and whether it's a 32 or 64-bit edition.



And again, we'll need that when we get to the&nbsp;&nbsp;
stage of installing MySQL.
Ok, back in my browser,&nbsp;&nbsp;
click the General Availability (GA) Releases&nbsp;
tab, to get back to the choice of installers.&nbsp;
I suggest you just grab the full product – the&nbsp;
second option – because you can re-install it,&nbsp;&nbsp;
if you need to, without having to download again.
I'm going to choose the second one,&nbsp;&nbsp;
so click its Download link.
Now it's asking whether we want to set up&nbsp;&nbsp;
an Oracle Web Account, because Oracle now own the&nbsp;
MySQL product. If you already have an account, you&nbsp;&nbsp;
can log in. We're going to click on "No thanks,&nbsp;
just start my download", then click Save file if&nbsp;&nbsp;
it doesn't start downloading automatically.
Now we need to open the file that we've&nbsp;&nbsp;
downloaded, so I'm just going&nbsp;
to select "Open file" here.&nbsp;
If you're using a different browser,&nbsp;
do whatever you'd normally do,&nbsp;&nbsp;
to open a file that you've downloaded.
The installer starts, and I'll give that a moment.&nbsp;
Click on "Yes", If it pops up, to allow&nbsp;
this app to make changes to your device,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and the installation should proceed.
It may pop up again and ask you to allow&nbsp;&nbsp;
this app to make changes again. In my case, it&nbsp;
did pop up that twice, so click "Yes" again.&nbsp;
If you get an option to apply an upgrade, click&nbsp;
"Yes" to allow the upgrade to be applied as well.&nbsp;
And now we get this screen, where&nbsp;
we can choose the setup type.&nbsp;
There are various radio buttons here to the left,&nbsp;
and to the right, it gives you a description&nbsp;&nbsp;
of what it's actually going to install.
So you can see we have a number of options.&nbsp;
You've got a Server only. This installs only the&nbsp;
MySQL server, which would be useful if you want&nbsp;&nbsp;
to run the server on a different computer,&nbsp;



rather than on your development machine.&nbsp;
We've got a Client only option – which is a sort&nbsp;
of compliment to the Server only option. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;
the one we'd install on our development&nbsp;
and user computers, if the server was&nbsp;&nbsp;
running on another computer.



We've got a Full option,&nbsp;&nbsp;
which installs everything.
But the option we're going to select&nbsp;&nbsp;
is the Custom option, so that we're installing&nbsp;
only the things that we need for this course.&nbsp;
I'm going to click on Custom,&nbsp;
and I'm going to click on Next.&nbsp;
Once we've done that, we get this screen here. On&nbsp;
the left-hand side, there's a list of available&nbsp;&nbsp;
products, and the right-hand side shows a&nbsp;
list of the products that are to be installed.&nbsp;
Currently, that's empty, because&nbsp;
we haven't selected anything yet.&nbsp;
So I'm going to come over here first, and expand&nbsp;
MySQL Servers by clicking on the plus. Do the&nbsp;&nbsp;
same to expand MySQL Server, then again to expand&nbsp;
the latest version – which for me is version 8.0.&nbsp;
You may have a later version there, and that's&nbsp;
fine. Install whatever is the latest version&nbsp;&nbsp;
available. For me, at the time I'm recording&nbsp;
this video, that's version 8.0. You can see&nbsp;&nbsp;
there are older versions I can choose, but&nbsp;
don't do that. Go with the latest version.&nbsp;
In fact, after expanding that, we can see version&nbsp;
8.0.34. You can see a lot of other versions like&nbsp;&nbsp;
8.0.33. Just choose the latest version you see.
The X64, at the end, indicates that this is a&nbsp;&nbsp;
64-bit version. If you see X86 there, then you'll&nbsp;
be installing the 32-bit version. You've already&nbsp;&nbsp;
checked whether your operating system is 32-bit&nbsp;
or 64-bit, so make sure that you choose the&nbsp;&nbsp;
appropriate version for your operating system.
I mention that because earlier versions of&nbsp;&nbsp;
the installer used to show both the&nbsp;
32-bit and the 64-bit versions here.&nbsp;
The installer changes whenever there's a&nbsp;
new version, and Oracle might decide to&nbsp;&nbsp;
show both versions again, in the future.
So if they do, choose the X64 version on&nbsp;&nbsp;
a 64-bit version of Windows, and the X86&nbsp;
version on a 32-bit version of Windows.&nbsp;
I'm running a 64-bit version of Windows, so&nbsp;



I'll select the X64 version – the only one&nbsp;&nbsp;
that's showing here – then click on the arrow,&nbsp;
to move it across to the right-hand side.&nbsp;
So that's now going to be installed.
The next thing we want to do is come over&nbsp;&nbsp;
here, to applications, and click on the plus&nbsp;
again to expand it. Expand MySQL Workbench,&nbsp;&nbsp;
by clicking on the plus, then again to&nbsp;
expand MySQL Workbench 8.0.34 – X64.&nbsp;
Once again, you may have to choose X64&nbsp;
or X86, if those options appear for you.&nbsp;
So I'm going to select the MySQL Workbench&nbsp;
8.0.34 – X64, and click the arrow to move&nbsp;&nbsp;
that over to the right-hand side.&nbsp;
I'll ignore all the older versions.&nbsp;
Once again, the version numbers&nbsp;
may change in the future. In fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;
the MySQL Server and Workbench programs&nbsp;
might even have different version numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
That's fine – they are often the same, but one&nbsp;
program might be updated separately to the other.&nbsp;
Depending on when you're watching this&nbsp;
video, they might be a later version,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but the principle is still the same. Just select&nbsp;
the relevant version, and select the 64-bit or&nbsp;&nbsp;
32-bit version if that option's available.
At this point, we've selected the only two&nbsp;&nbsp;
products we need, so I'm going to click&nbsp;
on Next, and then I'm going to click on&nbsp;&nbsp;
Execute. This is going to start out&nbsp;
downloading the MySQL software first.&nbsp;
And after that we will start the installation&nbsp;
of both those products, onto this computer.&nbsp;
And once that's finished, we need&nbsp;
to go through a configuration step,&nbsp;&nbsp;
to set up user names and so on and so forth.
Okay. So it's now finished downloading. I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;
to click on Next and Execute to install.
Now the install is complete its time to
configure. I'll click Next again. That&nbsp;
will bring up the configuration options.&nbsp;
And we've got a Config Type dropdown here,&nbsp;
where we can select various different options.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We're going to leave the default of Development&nbsp;
Computer, since that's exactly what we're doing&nbsp;&nbsp;
here – we're using MySQL as developers.
It shouldn't normally be necessary to&nbsp;&nbsp;
change any other options here – the&nbsp;
defaults will work for most computers.&nbsp;
Now in terms of the port, it needs to be a unique&nbsp;
port number that's not used anywhere else, or it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
not used for another application on this computer.
So 3306 will be fine for my computer.&nbsp;
Normally, that will work&nbsp;
for your computer as well.&nbsp;
The rest of the defaults are okay. You don't need&nbsp;
to change anything else there, click on Next.&nbsp;
Now we get to specify the Authentication Method.
You shouldn't normally change this,&nbsp;&nbsp;
we want strong password encryption –&nbsp;
that keeps our installation secure.&nbsp;
If you've already written MySQL applications,&nbsp;
and they can't be updated, then you can&nbsp;&nbsp;
specify the old-style authentication here.
But we're starting from scratch, and don't&nbsp;&nbsp;
have any existing applications to support. So&nbsp;
we won't change anything here, just click Next.&nbsp;
Now it's asking for what the root password is.
Now the root account is created automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;
by MySQL, and is a logon that is the&nbsp;
most powerful user in the system.&nbsp;
And generally speaking, it's good&nbsp;
to use that username and password&nbsp;&nbsp;
very sparingly – only when you really need to&nbsp;
do some sort of super administrative tasks.&nbsp;
So what we're going to do is assign a password&nbsp;
for it, which we need to do, but then we're&nbsp;&nbsp;
going to create a new user that we're going&nbsp;
to be using for our day-to-day use of MySQL.&nbsp;
So you want to enter a password that's&nbsp;
hard to guess, and is quite secure.&nbsp;
So I'm going to type in a password, then confirm&nbsp;
it by typing it in again. The password strength&nbsp;&nbsp;
is showing as Strong, so that's good.
Ok, That's the root user. As I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;
you'd only log in as this user when you need to do&nbsp;
administrative tasks. It's not a good idea to use&nbsp;&nbsp;
such a powerful login for normal use.
So the next thing we need to do,&nbsp;&nbsp;
is click on Add User.
We're going to create another user,&nbsp;&nbsp;
that we're going to be using for&nbsp;
the normal tasks in this course.&nbsp;
Type in the name of the user. I'm going to call&nbsp;
this one devuser – all one word – but you can&nbsp;&nbsp;
call it literally whatever you like.
This is the user that we'll log in as,&nbsp;&nbsp;
when we're working with our databases.
For the host, I'm going to change that to&nbsp;&nbsp;
localhost, using the dropdown arrow.
localhost means this computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;
so that ensures that it can only be used&nbsp;
locally. That's more secure, because we&nbsp;&nbsp;
only want to be using this username locally.&nbsp;
We don't want access from any external source.&nbsp;
Some students have reported that they don't&nbsp;
get localhost here – instead they see the IP&nbsp;&nbsp;
address 127.0.0.1. That's fine, that's the IP&nbsp;
address that localhost resolves to, so choose&nbsp;&nbsp;
that address if that's what you see here.
We're going to leave the Role set to DB&nbsp;&nbsp;
admin. There's other options you can choose&nbsp;
here, but I'm not going to change any of&nbsp;&nbsp;
that – I'm going to leave it on admin for now.
A database administrator can do things like&nbsp;&nbsp;
creating databases and tables, which is&nbsp;
what we'll want to do in this course.&nbsp;
And we also need to enter a password for this.
I suggest you make this password&nbsp;&nbsp;
different to the root user.
And make sure you remember both passwords.&nbsp;
I'm going to enter my devuser&nbsp;
password, then confirm it.&nbsp;
In this case, you can see again,&nbsp;
I've got a strong password.&nbsp;
So now we're done with that, click OK, then Next.
The next step is to configure the Windows service.&nbsp;
I'm not going to go into a lot of detail&nbsp;
about this, you can generally accept the&nbsp;&nbsp;
defaults on this screen.
I will mention that Start&nbsp;&nbsp;
the MySQL Server at System Startup checkbox.
If you'll be doing a lot of work with MySQL,&nbsp;&nbsp;
then you'll probably want to leave that ticked.
But if your computer is low on memory, or is quite&nbsp;&nbsp;
old and slow, then you should untick that box. In&nbsp;
a moment, I'll show you what it does, and how you&nbsp;&nbsp;
can start and stop the service manually.
So we're going to accept all&nbsp;&nbsp;
the defaults, and click on Next.
Leave everything unchanged on the Server&nbsp;&nbsp;
File Permissions dialogue, and click Next again.
We've now configured everything, and this screen&nbsp;&nbsp;
just gives us a chance to go back if&nbsp;
we decide we want to change something.&nbsp;
We don't, so click Execute.
The installer runs through the process&nbsp;&nbsp;



of configuring MySQL on this computer.
When it's finished, click on Finish.&nbsp;
Click on Next, and you can see we're now done –&nbsp;
the installation procedure has been completed.&nbsp;
Leave the checkbox to Start MySQL workbench&nbsp;
after setup ticked. And that's because we want&nbsp;&nbsp;
to run the Workbench, just to confirm the&nbsp;



installation is okay. So click on Finish.&nbsp;
Before we move on, I'm going&nbsp;
to close the browser down.&nbsp;
Ok, what I'd like to do next, is show you&nbsp;
what that "Start the MySQL Server at System&nbsp;&nbsp;
Startup" checkbox does – what effect it has, and&nbsp;
what you can do if you decided not to tick it.&nbsp;
We want to go into the Services on&nbsp;
our computer, and Microsoft move that&nbsp;&nbsp;
option around on different versions of Windows.
The way that will work on all current versions,&nbsp;&nbsp;
is to use the Windows key and R, then&nbsp;
type services.msc into the Run box.&nbsp;



Press Enter, and the services&nbsp;
management console starts up.&nbsp;
And once you've done that, you want to scroll on&nbsp;
down here, until we get to MySQL. The services&nbsp;&nbsp;
usually appear in alphabetical order,&nbsp;
and the name we're looking for is the&nbsp;&nbsp;
one we used when configuring the service.
We didn't change the default, so for me,&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's called MySQL80 – because I installed&nbsp;
version 8.0. Your name might be slightly&nbsp;&nbsp;
different, but you should be able to&nbsp;
find your MySQL service in the list.&nbsp;
And there's MySQL80. And you can see&nbsp;
in this case, it's actually Running&nbsp;&nbsp;



and the Startup Type is set to Automatic.
That's a good sign. The fact that it's&nbsp;&nbsp;
running tells us that the MySQL service has been&nbsp;



successfully installed, and is actually running.&nbsp;



That checkbox that we ticked, causes&nbsp;
the Startup Type to be Automatic.&nbsp;
You can override this, if your computer&nbsp;
is low on resources – if you haven't got&nbsp;&nbsp;
a lot of memory, you can change this.
So instead of it starting automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;
every time your computer starts, you can&nbsp;
right-click that and go into properties,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and you could make that Manual, and click on OK.
And what that would mean is, it won't start&nbsp;&nbsp;
automatically each time you turn the computer on.
So you could start the computer, and if you decide&nbsp;&nbsp;
you're doing some development in this course,&nbsp;
you could just come over to here, right-click,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and click on start. And that would start&nbsp;
the service for that particular session.&nbsp;
In my case, I'm happy to&nbsp;
have this run automatically.&nbsp;



I've got enough resources, so&nbsp;
I'm going to right-click again,&nbsp;&nbsp;
go into Properties, and choose Automatic.
So that every time I reboot the computer,&nbsp;&nbsp;
MySQL is available for me.
We've confirmed that's running okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;



so close the services down. All right. Getting&nbsp;
back now to the MySQL workbench, that started&nbsp;&nbsp;
automatically once MySQL was installed.
I want to start by clicking on this local&nbsp;&nbsp;
instance, so click on that, and it&nbsp;
brings up this little screen. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;
asking for the root user password.
So I'm going to type in that root&nbsp;&nbsp;
password that I set, earlier in the video.
And I'm going to choose not to save it. You&nbsp;&nbsp;
could choose to save the password if you like,&nbsp;
but for security reasons I prefer not to do that.&nbsp;
Click on OK.
And this has opened up, which is&nbsp;&nbsp;
a good sign that we got the password correct.
If we come over here, on the left,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and click on Server Status, that gives us&nbsp;
a bit of an overview of our MySQL service.&nbsp;
A lot of the information is&nbsp;
hidden by that right-hand pane,&nbsp;&nbsp;
so click the rightmost button, above it.
You can see we've got 3 panes here,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and each of those buttons corresponds to one&nbsp;
of the panes. The rightmost one has a blue&nbsp;&nbsp;
bar on its right-hand side. That shows that it&nbsp;
represents the right-hand pane, and clicking&nbsp;&nbsp;
it will toggle that right-hand pane on and off.
When we remove that pane, we can see the graphical&nbsp;&nbsp;
stats about our server.
It's Running, as you can&nbsp;&nbsp;



see here – so that's good.
We can also see the number&nbsp;&nbsp;
of connections, and other statistics.
But obviously, there won't be a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;
happening at the moment, and that's because&nbsp;
we haven't really started using it yet.&nbsp;
But bear in mind that we have actually&nbsp;
connected to the server, because we've&nbsp;&nbsp;
used MySQL Workbench to do that – in case you're&nbsp;
wondering where the connections are coming from.&nbsp;
Ok, come over here, on the left,&nbsp;
and click on Users and Privileges.&nbsp;
We can see the list of users – so you can&nbsp;
see there that we had the root account,&nbsp;&nbsp;
which was automatically created for us, and&nbsp;
also the devuser account that we created.&nbsp;
You might see a few other users, which are used&nbsp;
internally by MySQL. If you don't see them,&nbsp;&nbsp;
don't worry – sometimes the default settings&nbsp;
are changed, and these accounts don't show&nbsp;&nbsp;
up. That's fine, they're not accounts that we&nbsp;
need to do anything with, and it's best that&nbsp;&nbsp;
we don't make any changes to them.
The account that we'll be using,&nbsp;&nbsp;
most of the time, is this devuser account.&nbsp;
We want to be able to create new databases,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and perform all the other database-related&nbsp;
tasks that we're going to learn about.&nbsp;
That means we have to give this&nbsp;
account the necessary access.&nbsp;
Select devuser on the left, then&nbsp;
click the Administrative Roles tab.&nbsp;
You have full control over the level of access&nbsp;
that you can grant to users, but it's often easier&nbsp;&nbsp;
to use these roles that have already been created.
For example, there's a UserAdmin role that can&nbsp;&nbsp;
create users, but can't alter databases,&nbsp;
and there's a DBManager role that can&nbsp;&nbsp;
manage databases, but doesn't have the&nbsp;
access needed to create or modify users.&nbsp;
We will want to perform all tasks, so click the&nbsp;
top option – DBA – to make devuser a Database&nbsp;&nbsp;
Administrator. We'll be able to perform&nbsp;
all tasks, when we log in as devuser.&nbsp;
If you make any changes here, make sure you&nbsp;
click Apply to apply the change, otherwise&nbsp;&nbsp;
the access rights won't be granted.
All right. So click on View now,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and from the View menu select Home.
We go back to where we were. Now we're&nbsp;&nbsp;
going to come over here, and click on this&nbsp;
little wrench – to the right of the plus&nbsp;&nbsp;
sign – which is for managing connections.
That should open up this Manage Server&nbsp;&nbsp;
Connections screen here, as you can see.
So I'm going to click on this Local Instance&nbsp;&nbsp;
MySQL80, and we're going to click the Test&nbsp;
Connection button, at the bottom right.&nbsp;
If it wants a password, that root&nbsp;
password, again, then type it in.&nbsp;
And you can see that we've&nbsp;
Successfully made the MySQL connection.&nbsp;
So that tells us that MySQL is working correctly,&nbsp;
and we're able to connect to the database.&nbsp;
So that's okay. I'm going to click on OK.
All right. Now let's click on the New&nbsp;&nbsp;
button – over on the left. This time&nbsp;
we're going to add a new connection.&nbsp;
We're going to add a new connection, for&nbsp;
what we're going to be using in this course.&nbsp;
For the Connection Name, I'm just&nbsp;
going to call it development,&nbsp;&nbsp;
but you can call it whatever you like.
And we're going to change the Username.&nbsp;
Instead of root, we're going to change that&nbsp;
to the username we created, which was devuser.&nbsp;
Then I'm going to click on test connection, to&nbsp;
make sure we can connect as our development user.&nbsp;
We'll be asked for the password, so&nbsp;
enter your devuser password this time.&nbsp;
Remembering that this isn't the&nbsp;
root user this is the other user.&nbsp;
Click on OK, and you can see we made a&nbsp;
successful connection. So that tells us&nbsp;&nbsp;
that the username and password are valid,&nbsp;
and we're good to go. So click on OK.&nbsp;
Close this screen, and we've now got this second&nbsp;
connection configured under the MySQL Connections.&nbsp;
We're going to be able to use that in the course.
I'm going to finish the video&nbsp;&nbsp;
here. Now we're actually done.
In the next video, as I mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp;
at the start, it's a video for Mac users.
So if you've just installed this on Windows,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and you haven't got a Mac and/or a Linux&nbsp;
machine, you can skip the next one or two videos,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and move on to the video after that – where&nbsp;
we start working with this MySQL instance that&nbsp;&nbsp;
we've just installed and configured.
I'll see you, in that next video.
