In this section of the course,;
I'll be covering how to interact;;
with databases from a Java application.
I'll be primarily focusing on connecting to,
and communicating with a relational database.
I'll show you how to connect to a database,
using a connection string, and a special;
object, called a Java Database Driver.;
We'll get information from the;
database, through a database;;
language called Structured Query Language or SQL.
I'll demonstrate how to execute SQL statements as;;
strings against tables in the database, using;
Java's support, and how to process the results;;
we get back from these types of queries.
I'll also cover executing parameterized;;
statements, using Java's PreparedStatement,;
which allow SQL statements to be reusable,;;
more flexible, and less prone to;
some well known security issues.;
Many Database Management Systems support;
a built-in procedural language as well.;
This means there may be functions stored with;
the database, that you can use to get data,;;
or perform some action, rather than;
actually writing SQL code to do it.;
I'll be showing you how to make calls;
to these database stored procedures,;;
with Java's CallableStatement.;
Finally, we'll examine different object;
relational mapping or ORM technologies,;;
used by popular Java frameworks, to handle;
basic boiler plate interactions with databases.;
To do all of this, we'll need;
a database to test against.;
I originally was using SQLite for this section;
of the course, but have decided to switch to;;
MySQL for several reasons.
There were other options,;;
like selecting an in memory database like H2.
Or I could have chosen alternative relational;;
databases like PostGreSQL which is;
free and open source, or Microsoft's;;
SQL Server which has a free version.
I decided on MySQL for several reasons.
First, It's free, and downloaded from Oracle,;
and the installation isn't too difficult.;
Second, I think it's important to learn about;
CallableStatements, and for that, we needed a;;
database that support stored procedures.
There are work arounds for H2 and SQLite,;;
but I felt the work arounds might;
have been more confusing to students.;
Third, I offer a beginner's course;
in SQL which also uses MySQL,;;
so if you want to learn more, you'll be;
in a perfect position to take that course.;
Finally, MySQL is a popular industry standard.
On this slide, I'm showing you several surveys
of the popularity of market place databases.
The first is stackoverflow's annual survey which;;
solicits feedback from developers,;
on what they use professionally.;
This survey is limited to respondents, so it could;
be argued it's skewed towards professionals who;;
are just more likely to take such a survey.
The second is from Statista,;;
and the third from DB-Engines, which;
are similar and have similar results.;
The last survey polls the internet for;
monthly statistics, using the number of;;
mentions of the system on websites, the frequency;
of technical discussions, and the number of job;;
offers as part of their scoring system.
Make sure to check out these surveys,;;
and others if you're interested, or if you're;
trying to make this decision for yourself.;
However you look at this feedback,;
MySQL is squarely near the top,;;
so that's another reason I chose it.
Finally, just because the course will
be taught using MySQL, this doesn't;
mean that you have to use it.;
You're welcome to use whichever database you;
want, especially if you have another already;;
installed, and have experience there.
I'll be providing scripts to create;;
a specific database schema, for MySQL,;
which could be tweaked for your database.;
In addition, I'll show you several;
different connection strings,;;
to connect to different databases.
I'll be making an effort to use ANSI SQL,;;
a standard set of commands, which;
most databases should support.;
I'll try to avoid vendor specific SQL;
statements, or point them out when I can.;
There are good reasons to use;
ANSI SQL in your java code.;
Doing so, lets you swap the database engine,;
by simply changing your connection string.;
This does sometimes happen, as corporations;
decide the best way to house their data,;;
based on their own unique situation, and as;
technologies change and compete with one another.;
I'll explain all of this in;
more detail as we proceed.;
Ok, so let's move forward.
The next three videos will be;;
the MySQL installation videos, so pick the;
one appropriate for your operating system.
